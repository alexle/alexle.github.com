         <h2>How To Send A SMS Message With Python (easy way)</h2>
         <p>May 05, 2011</p>
      </div>

      <p>Python is a scripting programming language. It's easy to read, has great libraries, is documented very well, and is extremely versatile and powerful. It's my favorite language to work with and I have yet to come across a problem that it could not solve.</p>
<p>Can it send text messages? You betcha!</p>
<p>You'll be using the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) library. It's the most common protocol for sending mail and its communication is done using TCP.
import smtplib
Next, establish a secure session with gmail's outgoing SMTP server using your gmail account. A TLS or SSL connection must be used; the example below uses STARTTLS which is port 587.
server = smtplib.SMTP( "smtp.gmail.com", 587 )
server.starttls()
server.login( '<gmail_address>', '<gmail_password>' )
Now you're set up to send email. You will send a text message by taking advantage of each mobile carrier's email to SMS gateway!</p>
<p>For example, to send a text message to a t-mobile number, you would use <number>@tmomail.net. To send a text message to an AT&amp;T number, you would use <number>@mms.att.net.</p>
<p>Once you have your phone destination, all that's left is to add your message and send the mail.
server.sendmail( '<from>', '<number>@tmomail.net', '<msg>' )
5 lines of code. Not bad :)</p>
