         <h2>5 Hour Radiator Replacement</h2>
      </div>

      <p>I was driving home from work the other day when I noticed my car's heat gauge slowly past the 50% mark. This odd behavior was more alarming due to the puddles of liquid seen beneath my engine recently. And to the check engine light that had been on for over 5 weeks..</p>
<p>Turns out my radiator had a leak. I watched a youtube video called 10 Minute Radiator Replacement (Most Cars) and thought to myself, "that doesn't look that hard.."</p>
<p>A couple hours later, that thought was replaced with "what were you thinking alex". I got some help from an old friend and was able to finish around the 5 hour mark. It takes most auto shops 30min to replace a radiator. My back hurts and my hands are scuffed up, but overall it was a satisfying and good learning experience.</p>
<p>Old radiator, sorry I did not take better care of you.</p>
<p>Transferring hoses from old radiator to new radiator.</p>
<p>Bam! The new radiator ready to go to its new home.</p>
<p>One last look before installation.</p>
