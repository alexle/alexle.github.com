         Hi, I'm Alex Le.

         <h2>Putting Money In The Bank</h2>

      <p>The 2008 Beijing Olympics were awesome. Usain Bolt, Team USA basketball, Phelps, Walsh &amp; May volleyball. I was glued to the TV every night for a week.</p>
<p>The most memorable moment for me, however, was Michael Phelp's 100m butterfly. Phelps came back from a huge deficit (he was in 7th place at the half-way point) to overtake Milorad Cavic in a thrilling finish.</p>
<p>Phelps won by 1/100th of a second.</p>
<p><center><img src="/static/phelps.jpg" width="320" height="242" /></center>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
Phelps (left) out reaching Cavic (right).</div></p>
<p>When asked about his success in a later interview, Phelps said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we train everyday, sometimes there are workouts you don't like, don't want to do. Bob says you're putting money in the bank.</p>
<p>I guess I put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years, and we withdrew pretty much every penny in the bank. After Bob and I both grab a little break, it'll be time to start depositing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So whether you're training for a 10k, studying for a Calculus III test, or learning Wing Chun.. put some money in the bank. You never know when you'll need it :)</p>
