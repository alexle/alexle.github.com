            Hi, I'm <a href="/">Alex Le</a>. I live in Thornton, write firmware for disc drives, and try to learn something new every day.
            I like riding motorcycles, The Killers, working out, and a few other things.<br /><br />
            This is a place for my thoughts, goals, and interesting topics I come across.

         <h2>Putting Money In The Bank</h2>
         <p>Jun 28, 2011</p>

      <p>The 2008 Beijing Olympics were awesome. Usain Bolt, Team USA basketball, Phelps, Walsh &amp; May volleyball. I was glued to the TV every night for a week.</p>
<p>The most memorable moment for me, however, was Michael Phelp's 100m butterfly. Phelps came back from a huge deficit (he was in 7th place at the half-way point) to overtake Milorad Cavic in a thrilling finish.</p>
<p>Phelps won by 1/100th of a second.</p>
<p>When asked about his success in a later interview, Phelps said:</p>
<p>When we train everyday, sometimes there are workouts you don't like, don't want to do. Bob says you're putting money in the bank.</p>
<p>I guess I put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years, and we withdrew pretty much every penny in the bank. After Bob and I both grab a little break, it'll be time to start depositing.</p>
<p>So whether you're training for a 10k, studying for a Calculus III test, or learning Wing Chun.. put some money in the bank. You never know when you'll need it :)</p>
