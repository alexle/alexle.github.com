            Hi, I'm <a href="http://alexle.github.com/">Alex Le</a>. I live in Thornton, write firmware for disc drives, and try to learn something new every day.
            I like riding motorcycles, The Killers, working out, and a few other things.<br /><br />
            This is a place for my thoughts, goals, and interesting topics I come across.
