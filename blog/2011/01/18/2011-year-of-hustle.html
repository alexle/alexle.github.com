            Hi, I'm <a href="http://alexle.github.com/">Alex Le</a>. I live in Thornton, write firmware for disc drives, and try to learn something new every day.
            I like riding motorcycles, The Killers, working out, and a few other things.<br /><br />
            This is a place for my thoughts, goals, and interesting topics I come across.

         <h2>2011: The Year Of The Hustle</h2>
         <p>Jan 18, 2011</p>
      </div>

      <p>2010 was a year of enjoying life to the fullest, personal growth, and fulfilling old dreams.</p>
<p>2011 will be a year of Hustle. I have so many things I want to do and accomplish. And I'm going to do as much of it as I can. People always talk about what they want to do, or what they should do, or what they will do.. but they never do it. I don't want to be one of those people. When I look back on this year, I want to be able to say, "Dam Alex, you kicked some ass this year".</p>
<p>To help keep me motivated and on track, I'm going to ask myself this question at the end of every month:</p>
<p>What have you accomplished this month?</p>
<p>Here's a list of some of the things I did in January:
Read The Lost Symbol
Read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
Read The Girl who Played With Fire
Read The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest
Created app on google app engine
Learned Javascript
Worked out 5-6 days a week; can rep 205 x 4 now
Improved snowboarding skills
Not too much, but it's a start. In the next post, I'll share some of my goals for this year.</p>
