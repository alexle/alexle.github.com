<h3>Week 4 - 14mi LSD</h3>
<p>I logged runs of 4, 5, and 3 miles for the week. Slightly lower than what the training plan suggested, hopefully it won't impact the training too much. This week's LSD was my first run over 2 hours. And the first time I ever hit a "wall".</p>
<p>Essentially, hitting the wall is the point when your glycogen (stored energy) is depleted. Your legs turn to stone. Your pace slows to a crawl. Your body has nothing left in the tank. This uncomfortable feeling happens because your body starts burning fat for energy instead - which causes pain, dizziness, and extreme fatigue.</p>
<p>I usually get a surge of energy and excitement when I'm near my home. Just another .75 miles, yes! Not on this run. It felt like a bear jumped on my shoulders. The effort it took for each step was amazing, even though my stride length was less than that of a person walking. All my willpower was sapped out of me.</p>
<p>I described my situation to a co-worker (does triathlons). His stance was when doing endurance events, you have to <em>force</em> yourself to take in carbohydrates, electrolytes, and sugars at regular intervals, even if you aren't hungry or thristy. Since it takes time to process these fuels, being proactive will allow the energy to be available when your body needs it.</p>
<p>* Lesson: Fueling properly is extremely important. If you wait for your body, it's too late.</p>
<h3>Week 5 - 15mi LSD</h3>
<p>Major setback back this week with short runs of only 4, 3, and 3 miles. I have to put more effort towards them next week. As for the LSD, it was the most painful one yet. Calves, arches, hip flexors, IT band, and a bunch of other leg muscles I never knew existed were on fire. Is this what child birth feels like? It was the first time I had serious doubts about finishing the marathon.</p>
<p>I stuck to the same plan of water at 30 minutes, GU + water at 60 minutes, and powerade fuel at 90 minutes. Next week, I'll try to GU every 45 minutes and see if that helps.</p>
<p>* Lesson: When in pain, relax and focus on a couple steps at a time. It's ok to walk too.</p>
