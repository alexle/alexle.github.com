   <p class="post_content">
      <p>It's been a couple days since my <a href="http://alexanderle.com/blog/2012/first-14er-grays-and-torreys-peak.html">memorable hike</a> and I thought I would share what worked for me on the trip and what I would do differently next time. Here are some tips I'll be following on my next Colorado 14er:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Start early.</strong> Most hikers estimate one hour per 1000 feet of elevation gain. Plan accordingly because it can be dangerous on the summit if afternoon thunderstorms and lightning come in, which are very common during the summer in Colorado. We left Torrey's at 1:20 pm and it was hailing/raining at that point. Starting earlier and leaving the peak around noon would be safer for next time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bring plenty of water.</strong> I drink a <u>lot</u> of water every day and sweat profusely when doing physical activities. On the 8.4 mile RT hike we did, I brought a 100oz CamelBak, two 16oz water bottles, and one 32oz Gatorade (for electrolytes/salt) and there was less than 10oz water left in my pack at the end. Of course this varies for each person, but it's better to have <u>too</u> much water than not enough in my opinion. The general rule of thumb is 1 liter of water for every 3 miles you hike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prepare for ALL the elements.</strong> Check the weather report beforehand, but all bets are off when the elevation is this high. For warm weather, I had a synthetic base layer, shorts, and sunglasses. My friends had convertible pants (which looked very convenient) and hats. For rain and wind, I brought my Marmot Ether DriClime jacket and UnderArmour sweats. My friend used a poncho, but would not recommend it again since it flew around in the wind and blocked his vision of where he was stepping. I'd probably bring gloves (wet hands were ice cold from wind) and a beanie next time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay hydrated.</strong> Drinking when you're thirsty is too late (one can be a quart low on fluids before feeling thirsty), and puts yourself at risk for dehydration, fatigue, and cramps. According to <a href="http://www.highaltitudelife.com/dehydration.htm">this article</a>, the higher up you are, the more water your body needs to keep functioning. I recommend drinking small amounts of water frequently, which is another reason why a hydration bladder is nice to have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trekking poles are worth it.</strong> As we made our way up a steep climb, a 13 year old girl caught up to us and remarked, "I'll trade you my trail mix for your trekking poles. Now I know why people use them". They may look silly to some, but they reduce fatigue, stress on knees, and are a great help when negotiating slippery terrain. It's like having 4 legs to help you balance and maneuver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bring enough food.</strong> The amount of food to bring varies from person to person. On the last trip, our group only finished half the food we brought. Perhaps it was the altitude, physical exhaustion, or big breakfast we had. What worked well for us was eating small amounts of trail mix, beef jerky, power bars, and <a href="http://www.clifbar.com/food/products_shot_bloks/">Clif Shot Bloks</a> along the way. That kept our energy levels consistently high. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understand route. Have a map/gps.</strong> Plan and know your route in advance. There is a ton of information at <a href="http://14ers.com/">14ers.com</a> and <a href="http://protrails.com/">ProTrails.com</a>. I was always one to scoff at maps and didn't think they were necessary.. until I couldn't determine which path we needed to take on the way down. Luckily, my friend had a GPS map on his phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be safe.</strong> A small first aid kit with bandages, tape, gauze pads, and anti-bacterial wipes can go a long way. Asprin or Ibuprofen is good too. Know the signs of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001190/">altitude sickness</a>. Rest for a few minutes if you feel lightheaded, the lightheadedness is from a lack of oxygen to your brain. Bring survival gear if you expect to be pushing the limits of a day hike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Account for personal needs.</strong> Everyone remembers the essentials such as sunscreen and bug spray, but don't neglect the simple conveniences such as toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and extra socks. Some people even bring head lamps/flashlights, iodine tablets (to clean water), floss, and matches/lighter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enjoy it.</strong> Take in the majestic views that look like they came from a Brave Heart movie. Be content with hearing only the sounds of steps and heavy breathing as you climb a steep incline. Debate with your friends about what's going to happen next in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones">A Game Of Thrones</a>. Enjoy some of the best air you're ever going to breathe when you're on top.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind these tips are based on my experiences, and that each person's comfort level is different. Hopefully, this post was able to provide a sense of what one can expect on a 14er hike and how I plan to prepare for one in the future.</p>
