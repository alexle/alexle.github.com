   <p class="post_content">
      <p>I set a <a href="/blog/2012/2012-goals.html">goal</a> to run 100 miles in 2012. At the time, I thought it was going to be a breeze. 100 miles came out to a little over 8 miles a month, or a 2 mile run every week. It seemed so easy..</p>
<p>Six months later, I had logged only 25 miles and was ready to throw in the towel. Sub-35 degree and windy runs were miserable. Runs over 1.25 miles were tortuous and aching. And for reasons I couldn't explain, it felt as if I was getting <strong>worse</strong>. More <a href="/blog/2013/run-summary-and-analysis-2012.html">details</a> about this later.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I kept with it and after much pain, sweat, and tears, I'm proud to present the final mile tally of my runs this year:</p>
<p><img src="/static/nike-2012-total.jpg" width="300px" border="1px" class="center" /></p>
<p>It doesn't sound very impressive, but completing this goal ranks as one of the <strong>top-five</strong> achievements in my life so far. Not so much for the number of miles or difficulty of the runs. But more for the <a href="/blog/2011/money-in-the-bank.html">commitment</a> required to go through with it. There were so many days I just wanted to sleep in, or relax to a TV show after a long day of work. So many chances to say, "I'll just run tomorrow". And so many moments to simply <strong>stop</strong>.</p>
<p>I couldn't be happier with how well this goal played out. To say that it was a success is an understatement. Running this year has completely transformed my views on health and fitness, and combined with some <a href="/blog/2012/nasty-girls-of-crossfit.html">CrossFit</a> workouts, helped me become the fittest I've ever been.</p>
<p>While I understand that running isn't for everyone, it's hard not to share and endorse something that's had such a positive impact on your life. I use to be one of those people who believed "running was <a href="/blog/2012/why-i-hate-running-but-still-do-it.html">boring</a>" and "running was bad for your knees". Now, I  think differently and actually look forward to it.</p>
<p>As the year comes to a close, give some thought to some positive activities you dread or dislike (waking up early, making a budget, working out). With a plan and some focus, your view and life may change when all is said and done.</p>
