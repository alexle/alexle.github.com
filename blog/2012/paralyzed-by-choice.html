   <p class="post_content">
      <p>This is a picture of my living room:</p>
<p><img src="/static/living-room.jpg" width="560px" height="" class="center" border="1px solid" /></p>
<p>Notice the void in the middle of the room? It's been like this for a while now. I've been meaning to get a coffee table for utility and extra storage space, but I haven't been able to decide on one. Each time I shop for one, I get overwhelmed by the number of options and wonder if I'm making the best selection. Eventually, I give up and go home to think it over. Which really means do nothing.</p>
<p>I've noticed this "paralysis" happening more frequently within the last year. It was annoying at first, but as the unmade decisions piled up, it began to take a toll on my concentration and focus. Oftentimes, I would find my thoughts drifting to my "to-decide" list, throwing off my flow and productivity.</p>
<p>Apparently, this is not a new phenomenom (thank goodness). Psychologist Barry Schwartz did an <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html">interesting TED talk</a> called "The Paradox of Choice", essentially saying that more choices do not leave us happier, but instead more <strong>dissatisfied</strong> and exhausted. It's no wonder our brains are less efficient, which are already overworked and fatigued as it is.</p>
<p>So what can be done about it? Here are my ideas and plan going forward:</p>
<h3>Simplify my life and possessions.</h3>
<p>By doing so, this reduces the number of choices I have to make. Back when I had cable TV, I could flip through 100+ channels and still not be able to decide on one. Now that I've <a href="http://alexanderle.com/blog/2012/neatflix-my-netflix-api-demo.html">cut the cord</a>, I don't have to worry about if anything better is on TV. If nothing is good on the 5 channels I have, then I'll work on a project or go for a run instead, which is a win-win situation in my book.</p>
<h3>For most choices, one is as good as another.</h3>
<p>Instead of agonizing over whether to get a Sam Adams Octoberfest or Left Hand BlackJack, understand that both beers are probably delicious and there is no wrong choice. When I think about it, 90% of the choices I make each day have little meaningful difference from comparable options. Put the primary focus on must-have features, instead of nice-to-haves ones.</p>
<h3>View each choice, good or bad, as a learning experience.</h3>
<p>Life is an adventure and not perfect. So why set expectations as anything else? If I travel somewhere and don't like it, now I know. If it's amazing, even better! Either way, it's a lesson learned first-hand and a story to tell my friends.</p>
<h3>Is it even going to matter?</h3>
<p>Few choices we make are ever really that important in the long run. Aside from decisions involving a house, career, who to marry, and investments, I can't think of anything that <em>really</em> matters that much after 10 years. It definitely puts things in perspective when laboring over a "life-or-death" decision.</p>
<p>Hopefully, these ideas will aid in my decision making and ultimately, improve my focus. And if not, well at least <strong>now I know</strong>.</p>
