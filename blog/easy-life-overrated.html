<p>Imagine two days:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You sleep in. Wake to a hearty breakfast. The sun is out and it's a beautiful day to relax on the patio with a craft beer and snacks. Later, you retreat to your couch with Chinese takeout and watch all 8 episodes of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/">Stranger Things</a> on Netflix. In <strong>one</strong> sitting. You silently thank the person who invented sweatpants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's 5am and you're running up a trail in pitch darkness. You're cold, hungry, and tired. The wheels come off at mile 24. It's a struggle to keep moving forward. There's still <strong>10 miles</strong> left, you realize, before tripping over a rock and face-planting into the ground. You brush off the dirt and push your aching body on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Which day would you prefer? Most people would choose the first day.</p>
<p>I've lived both of these days. They're nice in their own ways. But given the option, I'd choose the <strong>second</strong> day nine times out of ten.</p>
<h2>Is An Easy Life Really That Great?</h2>
<p>Let's see. The first day was easy and relaxing. It required no mental or physical effort.</p>
<p>In terms of comfort, it was a 10/10. Just sit back and enjoy life. It's what we worked hard all week for.</p>
<p>Yet, when the day was over, I felt over-indulged, empty, and dare I say, <strong>hollow</strong>. My senses were dulled. There was no substance. No feeling of life. Just mindless zombie-consumption of food and entertainment.</p>
<p>Contrast that to the second day, which had punished my body and mind to absurd levels. My legs were wrecked. My toenails had turned black. I had aches in places I didn't even know could ache.</p>
<p>But the burger and fries never tasted better. The company of my friends never more appreciated. Everything was more vibrant. And I felt genuinely <strong>alive</strong>.</p>
<p>When you add in the sense of achievement, gratitude, and strength that followed, it's clear in my eyes which day impacted my life and overall happiness more.</p>
<p>Maybe an easy life isn't as perfect as we think it is. Pope Francis of the Roman Catholic Church certainly doesn't think so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear young people, we didn’t come into this work to ‘vegetate’, to take it easy, to make our lives a comfortable sofa to fall asleep on. No, we came for another reason: to leave a mark.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Nothing Good In Life Comes Easy</h2>
<p>Another reason why an easy life isn't all it's made out to be is nothing good in life comes easy.</p>
<p>Take a moment to think of the biggest accomplishments in your life. Good. Now think of the hardest things you've done.</p>
<p>Odds are many of them are the same. Isn't that weird?</p>
<p>Many of us want life to be easier. To have everything handed to us on silver platters.</p>
<p>We want to be promoted simply for showing up at work. We want to lose weight with magic pills. We want our marriages to improve without putting in effort ourselves.</p>
<p>But how good is anything if it comes easy? If we don't sacrifice, struggle, or work hard for something, we value it <strong>less</strong>. It doesn't mean much to us.</p>
<p>It's like those people who win the lottery and throw it all away in a couple years.</p>
<p>Conversely, when you put your heart and soul into a goal, you're going to appreciate that success more. You'll take pride and satisfaction in your accomplishment, knowing the sweat and work it took.</p>
<p>More importantly, a challenging life shapes and defines you in many positive ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It stretches your limits</li>
<li>It builds character and strength</li>
<li>It makes you more resilient and resourceful</li>
<li>It allows you to grow</li>
<li>It exposes you to life's highs and lows</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, challenges give you purpose. And overcoming them makes life <strong>meaningful</strong>. I love this line by Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, which sums up my thoughts perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the hard days, the times that challenge you to your very core, that will determine who you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Do You Still Want An Easy Life?</h2>
<p>Don't get me wrong. I'm all for easy days as much as the next person. Our bodies and minds need time to rest, recharge, and reflect.</p>
<p>I'm merely stating that there is value in hardship. Instead of seeking out a life of ease, we should embrace the <strong>hard paths</strong> in front in front of us. They are golden opportunities to grow and learn from.</p>
<p>If it's one thing I've learned in 2016, it's that we are capable of much, <em>much</em> more than we think we can do.</p>
<p>So choose the hilly route on your next run. Volunteer for that tough project everyone is afraid of. Push yourself and get uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I guarantee, you won't regret the results.</p>
