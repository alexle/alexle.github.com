<h1 class="about-title">Hello, welcome to my blog.</h1>

<p><img class="pure-img center" src="/static/alex_le_climb_garden_hero_image.jpg" border="0px" /><p>

I live in Colorado and write firmware for <a href="http://www.seagate.com/" target="_blank">disc drives</a>.
I like to read, work out, and tinker with technology and side projects.
</p>

<p>
Most of my programming experience is in C, but I dabble with Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and new frameworks in my downtime.
Did you know this blog was generated from only <i>130 lines</i> of Python?
Check it out at <a href="https://github.com/alexle/alexle.github.com" target="_blank">my Github</a>.
</p>

<p>
When I'm not at work or on the computer, you can find me immersed in a book or <a href="http://www.strava.com/athletes/alexle" target="_blank">outside running</a> somewhere.
I began running in 2012 and, well, I can't get enough of it.
</p>

<p>
You'll find that I write about running a lot. Mainly because I enjoy it and feel there's much to learn and improve on.
But also because I believe it's a wonderful metaphor for life, in so many ways.
