   <h1>Hello, welcome to my blog.</h1>
   <div class="home_post">
      <p>
      I live in Colorado, write firmware for <a href="http://www.seagate.com/" target="_blank">disc drives</a>, and try to learn something new every day.
      I like to read, work out, and tinker with technology and side projects.
      </p>

      <p>
      Most of my programming experience is in C, but I like to dabble with Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and new frameworks in my downtime.
      Did you know this blog was generated from <i>only 130 lines</i> of Python?
      Check it out at <a href="https://github.com/alexle/alexle.github.com" target="_blank">my Github</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      When I'm not at work or on the computer, you can find me immersed in a book or outside running somewhere.
      I started running 3 years ago and, well, I can't get enough of it.
      </p>

      <p>
      You'll find that I write about running a lot. Mainly because I love it and feel there's so much to learn and improve on.
      But also because I believe it's a wonderful metaphor for life, in so many ways.
