Over time, Prisca realized that a house is not about an investment and certainly not about freedom, "particularly for creative people, because it takes up space in your brain." For those in the early stages of life, she recommends really taking inventory: "Is it more important to have a house that's cool and attractive or to live a life that's cool and attractive? In retrospect, I wish I had spent my money living well rather than taking care of a house."



lose mobility, put money down

interest, repairs, insurance

to make money, need mobility, be nimble .. need to have choices, need to have freedom

tied down to house = can't move


I am in a very similar situation to you (24, similar income/savings, near Raleigh), and I also recently had this question. After some research and pondering, my decision was wholeheartedly to continue renting. The biggest reasons were flexibility, opportunity cost, risk, and lifestyle. Renting gives me the flexibility of moving within the next couple of years without worrying about whether my property appreciated enough to cover the real estate and closing fees on each transaction. The opportunity cost is the money going towards that down payment that otherwise could be invested in the market. The risk is that my portfolio would then be over-concentrated in the one leveraged property. The lifestyle of renting means I don't have to give a crap about maintenance, mowing the lawn, etc. Here are some articles by a few FI bloggers that helped convince me: Mr Money Mustache gocurrycracker jlcollinsnh

I also considered the question of townhome vs condo vs single family home. I decided I didn't like the idea of a townhome or a condo because the HOA fees cut into your expenses and they tend not to appreciate as much as single family homes. And, I decided I didn't like the idea of a single family home because it was more more space than I needed, and I didn't want to have to put up with the maintenance. If I were to buy, I decided that the option I liked the most was getting a 2 bedroom condo in the 120K-150K range (looking in Cary/West Raleigh mostly, definitely not downtown), which would give me some extra space if I wanted to add a roommate without too much extra cost compared to a 1 bedroom. I'd probably spend less with that option than I would renting, but I am continuing renting for now for the reasons mentioned above.

I know home ownership can be a great investment, but if you love travel, freedom and may find yourself able to retire at an age when moving around could be a great way to spend your time, is it really worth it to invest in a home?
