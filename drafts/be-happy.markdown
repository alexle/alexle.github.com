The Simplest Way To Be Happy
01-23-2014



That’s when it dawned on me: happiness comes from a genuine feeling of fulfillment. Fulfillment can come from different avenues, like accomplishing big goals, buying new things etc. But those moments will be fleeting.

I think lasting fulfillment comes from having a positive impact on the lives of others. Obviously it doesn’t only have to be by giving people money, it could be sharing knowledge with others, or serving others in some capacity.To me this is why the richest people can’t give their money away fast enough. Whether it’s Bill and Melinda Gates or Warren Buffett. They’ve figured something the average person probably never will: Happiness does not come from money; it comes from doing good for other people.

I think it is still imperative that we build wealth, at least that’s my goal. But I understand that my happiness will never come from it. I hope it only widens my radius of positive influence in the world and I am able to affect more lives.

Happiness that lasts
We don’t have to wait for financial independence to be happy, we can do things that make us happy now. But we need to be cautious because pursuing the goal of FI can distract us from the ultimate concern.

It will feel like the only thing that matters, until you get there and realize there is a whole lot more to life. One thing I can guarantee is that being financially independent can’t make you happy.

Accomplishing the goal will surely make you happy for a while, but that’s just like buying a brand new Tesla would make you happy. In time, the feeling will wear off.

So how can we find happiness that lasts?

You can start living now, and start feeling happier now just by helping others whenever possible. Try to think beyond FI for a moment…what does true happiness look like for you?



Our peak experiences don’t come during passive moments. Sure, we enjoy reading a book or watching Big Bang Theory or playing a videogame, but these aren’t the best moments of our lives. Instead, “the best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult or worthwhile.”

People are happiest when they forget their surroundings to focus on doing their best at something that challenges and interests them. In short, happiness is produced by total engagement in the pursuit of excellence.




[Happiness] is not the result of good fortune or random chance. It is not something that money can buy or power command. It does not depend on outside events, but, rather, on how we interpret them. Happiness, in fact, is a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated, and defended privately by each person. People who learn to control their inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives, which is as close as any one of us can come to being happy.

The paradox is that you have tremendous control over your life, but you give up that control when you try to control others. For the only way you can control others is to recognize their natures and do what is necessary to evoke the desired reactions from those natures. Thus your actions are controlled by the requirements involved when you attempt to control someone else.


You can improve your quality of life by either changing your environment or by changing how you interact with your environment. 


Happiness is not a strong, stable foundation upon which to build lasting, committed love. It is simply too unstable, fleeting, and constantly in flux, and the ways in which we achieve happiness changes as we change over time.

Honestly, sustained and immutable happiness is arguably the most ineffective goal you could set for your relationship because it’s not possible to achieve. The reality of happiness, just like any other emotion, is that it comes and goes, just like the in-laws during the holidays, 80’s fashion, or stomach cramps.

Well, today it’s time to bust out another cold, hard truth:

The point of marriage is not happiness. The point of marriage is growth.







What this implies is that happiness is not achieved in itself, but rather it is the side effect of a particular set of ongoing life experiences. This gets mixed up a lot, especially since happiness is marketed so much these days as a goal in and of itself. “Buy X and be happy,” or “learn Y and be happy.” But you can’t buy happiness and you can’t achieve happiness. It just is, once you get other parts of your life in order.

Happiness Is Not the Same as Pleasure
When most people think they are seeking happiness, they are actually seeking pleasure: good food, more sex, more time for TV and movies, a new car, parties with friends, full body massages, becoming more popular, and so on.

But while pleasure is great, it’s not the same as happiness. Pleasure is correlated with happiness, but does not cause it. Someone developing a drug habit, for example, was probably pursuing pleasure but may end up far from happiness. Someone having an affair might hurt their loved ones in pursuit of pleasure. The pursuit of immediate pleasure rarely results in long-term satisfaction.

Research shows that people who focus their energy on materialistic and superficial pleasures end up more anxious, more emotionally unstable and less happy in the long-run. Pleasure is the most shallow form of life satisfaction and therefore the easiest. Pleasure is what’s marketed to us. It’s what we fixate on. It’s what we use to distract ourselves. But pleasure, while necessary, isn’t sufficient. There’s something more.


What started as a way to cope with grief became an opportunity for growth. I’m reminded of the book Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy, by Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and psychologist Adam Grant, which focuses on life after loss. After the unexpected death of Sandberg’s husband, a friend told her, “Option A is not available. So let’s just kick the shit out of Option B.” I’m living my own Option B now. And running 100 miles helps me kick the shit out of it.


Happiness doesn’t start with a better relationship, a better degree, a better job, or more money.  It starts with your thinking and what you tell yourself today.

3. Happiness Is Closer Than You Think
We often look at outside sources for happiness: Travel, a new job, moving to a different city or county, a new partner, more experiences, etc. But if you’re unhappy now, you will probably be an unhappy person with new experiences.

A quote from the Japanese Zen Master Dogen explains it well:

Don’t look for happiness in other places. Find it right where you are. Once you become happy, it’s easier to stay happy.


stoics

In the book, Antifragile, Nassim Taleb borrows from Seneca to explain a way to live with zero downside.

To the stoics, there is no downside. If you lend someone money and they don’t pay you back, then it was your intention they have it. If they do pay you back, consider it a pleasant surprise. If your business fails, so be it. When you’re antifragile, you actually get stronger when you experience failure and defeat — the opposite of being fragile.

Ryan Holiday, borrowing from Marcus Aurelius describes this as turning the obstacle upside down. You often can’t control what happens, but you absolutely can control how you respond. Might as well turn everything to your benefit.

But there’s something far more fundamental than mentally reframing things to always be in your favor. You were born naked, and you will also die naked. You can’t take your possessions, or your “success” with you.

Everything in your life is a gift. Being alive in the first place is a ridiculous and rare privilege.

Being able to read, a gift. Not earned. Having any possessions at all. A gift. Indeed, feeling entitled to anything is the most skewed and confused perspective of reality.

You can’t earn the rite to be alive, or to have anything. Everything in your life is a bonus. If you’re still alive in 5 minutes from now, then the next 5 minutes are an unearned bonus.

There is zero downside in life, only upside. You literally have nothing to lose. You only have to gain. Hence the need for extreme gratitude. Moreover, hence the need for extreme giving. There’s nothing more beautiful than improving the lives of other people. Again, it’s all a gift. Why not share in the abundance?

Don’t you see it? Everything is abundance.

All around you, everything. All benefits. Seriously, look around your physical proximity. All upside. Said Max Planck, “When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.”

When you realize that everything in your life is an unearned bonus, you don’t get over-attached to what you have. You also don’t get over-obsessed or jealous about what you don’t have.

Come what may, and love it.

This isn’t to say you don’t have creative control over what happens. Quite the contrary, gratitude is the key to abundance. Responsibility is the key to freedom. Perhaps Thich Nhat Hanh put it most simply, “There is no way to happiness, happiness is the way.”




Your life can be truly amazing and wonderful, however, if you don't appreciate what you have, then you'd never feel truly happy. 

True happiness isn’t the expression of happy chemicals floating through our brains. True happiness comes from the willingness to face ourselves. Only through some of my most painful experiences have I come to live in true happiness.

To a great extent, we create our fate every single day, and most of the ills we suffer from are directly traceable to our own (controllable) attitude.  Life is packed full of uncontrollable events; in many situations the only thing we can control is the attitude we choose to respond with.

When you really take the time to think about it, everything happening around us is neutral and meaningless up until the point that we give it meaning.  And the questions we ask ourselves drive the meaning we create and the attitude we have about everything.

Regardless of what you’re going though, it’s about choosing:  Will I allow this to upset me?  Will I choose to make this bad or good?  Will I choose to stay or walk away?  Will I choose to yell or whisper?  Will I choose to react or take the time to respond?

When our course/coaching students come to us feeling down about a life situation they can’t control, we typically start by reinforcing the hard truth: sometimes changing your situation isn’t possible – or simply not possible soon enough.  You can’t get to a new job in an instant.  You can’t make someone else change against his or her will.  And you certainly can’t erase the past. But…

You CAN always choose an attitude that moves you forward.  And doing so will help you change things from the inside out, and ultimately allow you to grow beyond the struggles you can’t control.

Don’t: Do things you hate.

The average person has a 9-5 job he can’t stand, works for someone else and is surrounded by co-workers he doesn’t like, doesn’t have time (or desire) to do things he enjoys or try new and exciting stuff.

There are no hobbies in his daily schedule, no time for rest.
Living like that leads to misery.




So four years ago, on New Years Eve, I made the pledge to myself to stop trying to be happy.


So instead of saying to myself, This year I’m going to be happy, I said, This year I’m going to try new things. I’m going to meet new people. I’m going to go to new places. I’m going to push myself out of my comfort zone.

And if I’m not happy, well, I’m not happy, but at least I’ve had some interesting experiences.


The result of this was the best (and probably happiest) year of my life, at least up to that point. And I realized something obvious in hindsight, but still profound: Happiness is something that comes a lot more easily when we stop thinking about it.

If you find yourself asking, Am I happy? Replace the question with: Do I have [insert word] in my life?

Contentment
Enjoyment
Laughter
Well-being
Peace of mind
Cheerfulness
Playfulness
Hopefulness
Blessedness




2. Practice living in the present.

Letting go of past regrets and future anxieties is not easy, but it’s the fastest way to live a full and enjoyable life. Think about enjoying each moment for its own unique role in the ongoing narrative of your life.

7. Separate your happiness from your achievements.

We all need to learn to separate our happiness from our achievements. It’s okay to feel content with our lives simply because we have an inherent sense of self-worth.o

9. Remove things that prevent happiness.

This is actually a lot more important than finding things to make you happy.








*Persian: A thousand nations of the Persian empire descend upon you. Our arrows will blot out the sun!*

*Stelios: Then we will fight in the shade.*

<a href="/static/300_shade.jpg"><img src="/static/300_shade.jpg" alt="300 fight in the shade" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" width="560px" /></a>

Ask someone what they think will make them happy and you'll hear the usual answers: Winning the lottery. Getting a promotion at work. Being in a relationship. Owning their dream home or car.

Yet, there are many people in those situations who *aren't* happy. So why do people pin their hopes of happiness to them? Oftentimes, what we perceive to be great  Then why do people

To me, the answer is simple.  reason is because those events are external. too much focus on external events for happiness. 

But the world doesnt change all that much if I have more money, a different space, a better job, or a nicer car. The wrapping paper is different, but the gift inside stays the same.


  Too many people depend on others, or outside sources, to gain happiness, but the truth is it always comes from within.

I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of, so they can see that it's not the answer. ~Jim Carrey 

short period of fulfillment. 

Thinking that unhappiness will be wiped out by having more things is just an illusion, it only leads to disappointment in the long run.
The only external food, water, and shelter

Growing up, I fell into the trap of believing It's powerful to realize that our happiness is largely in our control, rather than an artifact of some ideal set of external circumstances

Happiness is not so much about what you have. Happiness is about how you interpret what's in front of you. 

<center><b>*Change your perspective.*</b></center>

Instead of i have to, say i get to.

how change perspective?


Being comfortable can make you happy. But it doesn't guarantee happiness.

No matter how many beautiful things you surround yourself with, nice cars, a comfortable house, a relaxed lifestyle, security or good food it somehow fails to fill that hole.


The confusion is that we think we’ll be happy if we just get what we want and need. But anyone who’s tried to get what he wants and needs knows that even when he gets what he wants and needs, he still wants and needs more.

But I don’t think the hazard here is our focus on the present moment. The hazard comes from seeking happiness in the wrong places, in places where happiness does not exist, in stuff we want and in stuff we think we need—in stuff we can get with money.

If money were important to happiness, rich people would be happy, and poor people unhappy. But often the opposite is true.

The actor Jim Carrey once said: “I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it’s not the answer.”
<hr width="75%">

We all fall into this trap sometimes. "If only I had this thing, I'd have enough." "When this happens, we'll be happy." Motivation to work toward future rewards is a good thing, but pinning happiness on those future rewards is not.

I'm not an expert on happiness. just my own life experiences and observations from it.

Keep in mind that .. lots of tips online on how to be happy .. yes it works .. but the most important step to take comes from looking within yourself to create your own happiness.

we manage our happinesss .. be positive, grateful .. have no expectations.


###Be Appreciative###

Choose an everyday object. Spend five minutes pondering this question: What did it take for this object to arrive to you? Think about all the people who were involved.
For example, consider your cup of coffee. Someone:
Poured the coffee.
Ground the beans.
Transported the beans.
Grew the beans.
Designed the shape, color and size of your cup.
Transported the cup.
Made the cup.
Invented a coffeemaker.
 
Imagine the different challenges and setbacks these people faced in their lives. Yet here you are with your coffee.

When your world feels overwhelming, expand your vision just like this anytime, anywhere. Peel back the layers and develop an appreciation for the truckers, growers, inventors and everyone else who bring us the things we rely on.


###Practice Gratitude###

If you have a job, consider yourself lucky and treat your job as if you won the lottery. Do not complain about a crappy bonus or a lack of promotion when so many people would do anything to be in your shoes. 

One of the ways that you can start experiencing happiness right now is simply by letting yourself express your gratitude. You might be thinking, I don't have anything to be grateful for.Even though it may seem like you have nothing to be grateful for, I'm sure you didn't look hard enough. No matter where you are in life, there will always be someone above you and someone below you in terms of financial success, relationships, health, etc. This is exactly why you will never run out of things to be grateful for, just take a closer look at what you have.

###Remember Past Struggles###

My brother and I used to own a sandwich deli in Downtown Denver. It was 

So, when the deadlines start to pile up or 

Whenever I got yelled at by a client or boss or had to travel thousands of miles for a one hour long meeting, Id remember back to my high school days and smile. I had this immense fear that if I did not do well in school, I would end up flipping burgers in the morning, stuffing envelopes in the afternoon, and moving boxes at night for a living.

Nowadays, writing three to four times a week online is a piece of cake compared to all jobs Ive held prior. Whenever I start to feel burnt out or sorry for myself, I laugh at how silly I am and think, How the hell can you get burnt out sitting in the hot tub writing a post? Dont you remember your past? Stop complaining! I sometimes get lazy and need all the motivation I can get to carry on.

I encourage everyone to work a minimum wage job growing up or find a job you might feel is beneath you at some point in your life. Once you experience craptasticity, you will not only appreciate everyone who currently works such jobs, youll also become much more appreciative of what you have.

###Put Yourself In The Other Shoe###

Put yourself in your boss's shoes. Figure out the challenges your boss will encounter that day and be prepared to offer solutions. Anticipate the questions that your supervisor may ask about your work or a project and have thoughtful answers or next steps for them to take. Thinking ahead can really show that you're an invaluable team member.

Teach says it's easy to be resentful of your boss, especially if they treat you a certain way, but they have a job to do, just like you, he explains. There's a lot about their job that you don't know about or see, so don't assume that they're out to get you, he adds. Sometimes they act a certain way for a reason perhaps their boss is putting a lot of pressure on them so try to be understanding.

###Can't Control###

4. Waste Energy on Things They Cant Control. Mentally strong people dont complain (much) about bad traffic, lost luggage, or especially about other people, as they recognize that all of these factors are generally beyond their control. In a bad situation, they recognize that the one thing they can always control is their own response and attitude, and they use these attributes well.

###See The Big Picture###

So why stressed that blissful day on his boat? The same reason most of us get stressed: frustrated expectations. had an important call to make and cell phone wasn't working. was experiencing the gap between what he expected to happen and what was actually happening.

That's the underlying cause of stress and it's afflicting us more these days than ever because our expectations keep rising, thanks in part to exponential improvements in our technology.

In a hilarious interview with Conan O'Brien, the comedian Louis C.K. talked about how everything is amazing right now and nobody's happy. He tells the story of being on a plane and, for the first time, experiencing working internet at 30,000 feet. He was amazed. The person in the seat next to him was also surfing the web happily until the connection dropped. The man immediately threw his arms up in the air and yelled, "This is bullshit!"

"How quickly the world owes him something he knew existed only 10 seconds ago." Louis C.K. said. I fall into this trap, and most people around me do too. We expect more not only from our technology, but from each other and from ourselves.

Rob is usually laid-back in the face of his ever-present problems precisely because they're ever-present. He expects them. Renters always have complaints. Banks always want more information. Lawsuits happen. Valuations always change. These things are routine and he has routine responses to them, so they don't stress him out.

But that day on his boat, Rob was expecting his cell to work. So the cell outage far from land, where there's no alternative means of communicating his absence on an important phone call created a stressful unmet expectation.


Which leaves us with what I've come to believe is the best strategy for reducing stress: Change your expectations.

In other words, get used to not getting what you want. I know this isn't consistent with the kind of go-get-'em attitude most of us have been taught to embrace. But most of the time, fighting reality is not worth the effort. Either you can't change what's around you, or the fight is more stressful than the reward.

If changing your expectations proves too hard, your next best move is to get some perspective.

Imagine a scale from 1-10 with 10 being the worst reality you can imagine. Like living in a war zone or being in the World Trade Center on 9/11. Maybe 9 is a serious illness that most probably will result in death. Perhaps 8 is something that will forever alter your life, like going to jail or an accident that puts you in a wheelchair. Let's say 7 is something that temporarily alters your life like losing your job or having to move out of a home you can no longer afford.

Do you see where I'm going with this?

Almost everything we freak out about is somewhere in the 1-2 range of dashed expectations. In other words, our moods and our stress levels are determined by events that actually matter remarkably little.

That's useful to remember when you find yourself utterly irritated at your cable company because they erroneously added $5 to your bill or keep you on hold for 30 minutes while they investigate the matter. Or when a direct report gives you work you consider sloppy. I'm not saying don't correct the work. I'm simply suggesting it may not be worth getting worked up about.

That's not always easy. A number of small stressors add up to a lot of stress and it's natural to be stressed by things that don't really matter in the whole scheme of things. I do it all the time.

But we can substantially reduce our stress by recognizing that in many situations, we have become perfectionists in realms where perfection isn't necessary, realistic, or even useful.

Rob's stress was highest when he thought the problem was just with his cell phone. But, eventually, he found out that there was a cell outage throughout the Bahamas. Somehow, that helped him change his expectations. He knew there was nothing he could do.

And once he settled into his new reality, he was able to get some perspective. Where was missing that call on the scale from 1 to 10? No more than a 1.

And just like that, no cell service for 12 hours turned into a real vacation.

Many of us forget that the simplest things in life are the most important. 


3. Share gratitude. In her bestselling book, The Happiness Project, Gretchen Rubin says, A grateful spirit is very important to a happy life, and, in fact, the more I think about happiness, the more importance I attribute to gratitude.Gretchen recommends cultivating and practicing gratitude every day. Oprah agrees: Be thankful for what you have; youll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you dont have, you will never, ever have enough.Being grateful for what you have is important, and thanking others for their contributions is valuable too. The positive benefits of gratitude multiply as you spread it around. When you thank others, you build relationships in a spirit of mutual happiness and fuel their expressions of gratitude too. Not convinced?
