Be Consistent
The easiest way to become a better runner is to run more. Cross training is a great way to boost general health and maintain fitness when you are injured, but if you want to get faster, the lionøs share of the work is done on the roads.

Follow the 10 Percent Rule
Injuries are an inevitable part of running. Run long enough, itøs going to hurt. But the single biggest reason weøve seen runners sidelined is because they take on too much, too soon. Often, this comes because they registered for a marathon and started running far more miles than their bodies were prepared for. The easiest way to prevent this: never increase your mileage by more than 10 percent from one week to the next.

Marathons are Overrated
By all means, do one or a dozen marathons. But 26.2 miles is not the end all be all of running. Running your fastest 5K can be just as impressive, rewarding, and fun.

Hills are Speedwork in Disguise
They make you stronger, mentally and physically. And they activate all the right muscles for a killer turnover during your next race. So start adding more elevation during your higher-effort tempo and long runs.

Most Shoes Work For Most People Most of the Time
The shoe walls at running stores have gotten far simplerøgone are many of the categories like ømotion control.ø Thatøs because, most shoes deliver a balance of cushioning and stability that most runners need to get through easy mileage. Advanced runners may want racing kicks, or a minority of runners may really have a biomechanical need for an extremely stable shoe. But for most of us, the best shoe to start with is one that fits comfortably. Shoes like the Nike Pegasus, Brooks Ghost, Saucony Ride, and New Balance 880 are good places to start.




I donøt believe in shortcuts. One appeal of long-distance racing is that there is no way of faking fitness. A runner may be lucky to get good weather or may have chosen a flat, fast course, but he or she still has to run for one or more hours. Any runner who attempts a long distance race without properly preparing courts disaster.

Worse still, this failure canøt be hidden. On race day, it becomes clear who did their homework and who didnøt. Hitting the wall is no myth; itøs a real physiological event that occurs when the body runs through its glycogen stores. Glycogen is the bodyøs preferred source of fueløit burns cleanly and is readily available as blood sugar. The body stores about a two-hour supply of glycogen in the liver, more than enough for most of its needs.

Problems arise, however, when we ask our body to work harder than weøve trained it to do, especially over long periods of time. When we eat through our available glycogen stores, we experience a sudden drop in energy. Itøs as if our power cords were just cut or we suddenly were running through cement. The loss of energy can come on suddenly, like a car running out of gas.

Thatøs hitting the wall.

A runner who hits the wall suddenly slows from a run to a shuffle or even a walk. Itøs a very public declaration that the runner didnøt prepare for the kind of race she or he was trying to run.

Hitting the wall isnøt inevitable, however. Long runs done in training trigger an adaptation response in the body, forcing it to rely increasingly on fat for fuel instead of just glycogen.

Fat is not the bodyøs preferred source of fuel because processing it requires some additional steps, but there is ample fat in even the leanest body to fuel many hours of high-intensity work. Whereas glycogen requires water in order to be stored, fat does not, so the body stores it very efficiently. Fat also is twice as calorie dense as glycogen, logging 9 calories per gram, as opposed to 4 calories per gram of glycogen, so a little can go a long way. So even though most people might think of fat and calories as something to be restricted in dieting, fat is in fact an importantøand for runners, a crucialømeasurement of fuel. That is, if the body can be taught to use it.




Thatøs what weøre told from a young age. Define your endpoint. Make a concrete goal. Know where youøre going before you begin. See it, taste it, smell it, feel it, hear it. This is your vision. Without it, you end up going nowhere. You are doomed to the land of spinning wheels and stuck-ness. Donøt get distracted. Donøt give in. Do not, under any circumstances, waiver from your vision. Just keep your head down. Your job is to outwork, out-grit, out-think and outrun everyone else. Until that vision becomes your reality.

Indeed, this is often whatøs necessary to achieve something big. But, thereøs a problem. More times than not, that vision is built upon false assumptions. We believe that achieving our vision will make us happier, more fulfilled, confident and content. It will give us a greater sense of power, prestige, respect, authority and connection. And, it may. But, all too often, I does not.

Having sacrificed mightily and endured days, months or even years of fierce labor, and pushing away anything and everything but the vision, we get exactly what we wantøwe achieve our grand visionøonly to find ourselves saying, øhuh, I donøt feel like I thought I would.ø Then, with alarming frequency, we spiral into the abyss of dismay once we realize how much of our lives we gave up in the name of achieving something that was, in the end, an illusion.

So many times, we end up locking in an endpoint, working fiercely to get there, sacrificing relationships, health, time and a healthy serving of soul in the name of making our visions our reality, only to realize, we donøt actually want what we worked so hard to get once we get it. It doesnøt make us feel the way we thought and hoped it would. It doesnøt solve the problem we wanted solved, or deliver the delight we yearned to experience. Or, even if it does, for some reason, it still leaves us feeling empty, maybe even a little burned-out and numb, instead of full and alive.

I call this øVision Collapse Syndrome.ø Iøve been hit by it (sadly, more times than I care to admit). And, nearly every person Iøve known who strives to make manifest a life of accomplishment, impact and meaning has endured this same phenomenon.

So, how do we avoid Vision Collapse Syndrome?

How do we substantially increase the likelihood that the thing weøre working so hard to attain is actually the thing weøll truly want, if and when we get it?

Instead of starting with a well-defined vision, end with it. Begin, instead, with values and vectors. Values are, very simply, an expression of what is most important to you. An example might be øfamily, financial security, love, honesty, service to others.ø This is a great starting point, but values become far more actionable when you add a verb or action phrase that allows each value to actually guide your behavior. So, you might expand this list to:


To be present and engaged in the lives of my partner and children, to earn enough to provide for the day-to-day needs of my family, to save for retirement and pay for the advanced education of my children, to act in a loving way when confronted with difficult situations, to be honest with myself and others with regard to big, critical decisions in life, and to serve families in need.ø






Buying a home is a lot like running a marathon. Very few people can just decide to up and do it in the next day or two.

It takes preparation, patience and perseverance.

If you’re looking to buy your first home in the next 5 years or so, you’ll likely need to start now to ensure you’re in the proper financial shape to do so. To complete the marathon metaphor, here is what you’ll need to do to help get you to the homebuyer finish line.


Runners always want to run faster, run more miles, and crush their personal bests, and they want it now. To be more accurate, they wanted it yesterday.

I know I felt this way before I donned my coaching cap. I wasnøt satisfied with a workout unless I needed to be carried off the track and was forced to spend the rest of the day passed out on the couch. That was dedication. Surely, this is what it took to be the best runner I could be.

Unfortunately, this mindset couldnøt be more wrong.

Not only did this way of thinking impact my short-term goals, thanks to all-too-frequent injuries and bouts of overtraining, but as youøll learn in this article, it likely affected my long-term progress as well.

As Iøve matured as a runner and changed my perspective on training as a coach, Iøve come to fully appreciate and value the art of patience. This shift in mindset wasnøt easy and it didnøt happen overnight. Hopefully, with the help of some hard, scientific data and a sprinkling of anecdotal evidence, this article can accelerate your maturation as a runner and help you achieve your goals.

Finish A Workout Feeling Like You Could Have Done More
This is a phrase youøll hear from any running coach worth his or her salt. As elite coach Jay Johnson espouses to his athletes, øyou should be able to say after every one of your workouts that you could have done one more repeat, one more segment or one more mile.ø






He also repeated two mantras throughout the race: This is my day and Iím made for this shit.

ìInstead of always looking at a number and reacting to it, you want to pay attention to your sensory dataóyour heart rate, your breathing, your perceived effort level and figure out what you need to do and make small adjustments,î he says, which will help you learn what type of pace you can maintain.

And when you do experience bad patches, you can usually get through them by staying engaged and positive, although thatís tough to do even for the most seasoned runners, Flaherty says.

ìInstead of focusing on your pain or how long you have to go, focus on how you can be more efficient right now. Even if you donít meet your A goal, in retrospect you can usually take pride in having fought as hard as you could and knowing that you did,î he says.

, I realized something important: I like training for marathons. I enjoy the weekend long run (and not only because it justifies pizza and wine Fridays!), I like the structure of a training plan, I don't mind feeling a little soreóoften.
Running a marathon was always one of those things "crazy people" did. Then at age 32, with no running background whatsoever, a good friend bought me a ticket 

Run Harder and Easier

The principle, "make your easy days easier and your hard days harder," couldn't be truer. But most runners tend to stay in the middle and do most of their runs at a moderate effort. They're missing out on a crucial way to improve running endurance when it's most responsive to training adaptations.

Let's start with easy runs. It's critical that your easy runs are truly easy. To keep yourself honest, it can be helpful to wear a heart-rate monitor to ensure your heart rate stays low enough to qualify as easy. The easy run is not meant to help you gain fitness. It's simply in your schedule to add a little bit of mileage and promote recovery.

More: A Fresh Perspective on Recovery Runs

With harder workouts, many runners don't put forth the effort they need to maximize fitness gains. Instead, they start to feel fatigued and cut the workout or slow their pace. In effect, they're moving the difficulty of the workout closer to a moderate level. The next time you run a hard workout, make it exactly that—hard.

How hard could it be? I've played basketball for 2 straight hours. I've played football, hockey.

I've since completed 3 marathons 

The first and last thing to keep in mind is -- whether it's Chicago or another marathon -- it's a journey. And the point of the journey is not just about arriving at the end, it's about everything that happens along the way. Embrace it, draw from it, endure it and own it: the spirit of the marathon.

Something that you once thought was impossible. Really impossible. But you're there, ready to make the impossible possible. Good for you.


Oh you run? Secret handshake.  

"Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional." (Haruki Murakami)

but I was running like a moron in the first miles and ALWAYS hit the wall. My first marathons basically turned in to run/walks – now I RUN a marathon – as in – not stopping for 26.2 miles. This is because I know how to pace myself better now




1. Stop looking at your watch and Run By Feel

Your watch is not a dictator. You are the master of your mind and body. Only you can determine how hard or how easy to run, when to speed up or when to slow down. You determine your pace. Your watch does not.

The pace your watch doesnít tell you about is how much sleep you had last night. It doesnít tell how tired your legs are. It doesnít measure cumulative fatigue from weeks of training. It certainly doesnít measure your stress levels. All of these are factors that determine how a workout goes. Bottom lineóyour effort level matters more than the pace ran.


In my first two marathons, I totally bonked. I was on pace, then suddenly I slowed. Soon, I was reduced to a walk and I no longer cared about my time. I hit the wall and it wasnít pretty.

Heading into my third marathon, I set my mind to bonk-proofing my running in training by employing some very specific workouts. On race day, the bonk never came and I finished strong during the final 10K.

Hereís how I approached  my training differently:

Bonking Defined
To bonk or hit the wall is to reach a point of exhaustion where you experience a sudden and dramatic reduction in your pace. Itís not tiredness. Itís exhaustion of mind, body and soul.

Exercise scientists have been working for years to find out the exact cause of bonking. Early on, they looked at muscle carbohydrate (glycogen) stores, blood glucose (sugar) and muscle damage, but nothing was definitive.

Then they looked at the brain and nervous system. They found changes in neurotransmitters and within the central nervous system. But again, there were always exceptions to when runners should have bonked but didnít, and some bonked when it wasnít expected.

The current theory is that bonking is a complex interaction of all of the peripheral factors, like muscle glycogen, blood glucose levels, muscle damage and fatigue, as well as central factors (some at the conscious level and some subconscious). In a nutshell, the brain operates like a carís computer system. In a car with stability control, for example, if the computer receives feedback that the car is out of control, the computer will do all it needs to do to keep you safe.

In the body, renowned researcher Tim Noakes calls this the central governor, and it acts similarly to the computer in your car. Noakes suggests that your brain, based on feedback from the body and within the brain itself, perceives that running at your race pace for the race distance is a threat. As a result, it produces the initial feelings of fatigue, similar to how you feel in miles 15 to 20 in a marathon.

If you keep running at that current pace, it makes you feel more and more fatigued and gets ready to cut the power. If you keep going, the brain believes this threat is becoming dire and shuts down power to the muscles.

The result? You bonk.

However, if you can keep your brain (i.e., the central governor) happy so it doesnít perceive your race pace for the race distance as a significant threat, it will let your body keep racing along. Luckily, the bonk point is trainable, and with exposure to training and some specific bonking runs, your central governor wonít put the brakes onóinstead, it will help power you to the finish.

There is no luck involved in finishing the Marathon, the ingredients required to tackle this formidable challenge are straightforward: commitment, sacrifice, grit, and raw determination. Plain and simple.

Then, at mile 20, the voice looms louder than ever. It hurts so bad you want to stop. You must stop. But you don’t stop. This time, you ignore the voice, you tune out the naysayers who tell you that you’re not good enough, and you listen only to the passion within your heart. This burning desire tells you to keep moving forward, to continue putting one foot in front of the other no matter the consequences.

There’s not going to be a miracle on race day where you suddenly go ten percent better than you’ve ever gone before.’ Each athlete, whether you’re in the pro ranks or an amateur, you know what you’ve done in training and your parameters and what levels you can maintain. You need to stick to your levels. You need to be disciplined. And it’s hard to do. With the energy of the crowds, and with race day finally being here after months and months of build up, and when you’ve got good legs at the beginning of the race, the tendency is to push. But in Kona, if you go too hard you’ll pay for it. So you always want to get in your best physical shape for Kona, but then race smart. Don’t be scared to go for it, but go for it later.

You can talk to people who have run marathons before. You can listen to how they say that life "totally changes" once you commit yourself to a training program. The truth? You don't fully understand just how much it really does until you go through it yourself. It goes a little something like this: Wake up every morning, sleep my alarm, roll over and turn a light on, get out of bed, lace up my sneakers. Life feels like run, eat, work, eat, sleep, repeat. See what's missing from that equation? Friends. Family. Extra curriculars, if you will.

With just under three weeks until race day, I'm anxious. I'm nervous. I've done the long run. I've conquered the 22 miles and the taper has officially arrived. But if it wasn't for the constant support of my friends and family, my vision of the finish line on November 2 wouldn't seem so clear. Sure, I miss late night outings, lingering in restaurants over desserts and one-too-many glasses of wine for hours at a time. (I also miss sleeping in on the weekends.) Instead, I've traded those outings for at-home dinners. For weekend coffee dates. For text messages and phone conversations when I have to squeeze in a post-work run instead of grab a bite and laugh over what ridiculous thing Kim Kardashian tweeted last.

But you know what? When we make goals that are great, goals that are worthy -- the sacrifices don't feel like sacrifies. They feel necessary. It's all necessary, and it's all coming down to one day:


 It made me wonder, øWhat else could I conquer?ø


What is it about the 26.2 that you love most? 
Itís hard to describe to someone who's never done one. Running 26.2 miles is such a rush and is the biggest thrill, it gives me goose bumps. Some people don't get it and think you're a little crazy, but it really is such a rush. The fans, the ability to run 26.2 miles, having people lined up and cheering - it's amazing. Anyone that has run one gets it.  - See more at: http://www.oiselle.com/blog/comeback-racing-begins#sthash.e8M0kOHg.dpuf


  But I learned a lot during that experience and it changed my life, and my perception of myself, forever.
  
fter the NYC Marathon I am going to totally switch gears, lower my mileage and really focus on a track season next year. I plan to race some indoor races, the US Championship and hopefully the World Championship. I need to get back to running 31 minutes for the 10K and right around 15 minutes for the 5K.

Oh you ran a marathon? Hugs and kisses and buy $100 rounds beer. 

Dehydration. Entering a marathon under hydrated is a huge mistake. I am certainly not suggesting you should over hydrate {thatís another issue all together} but I am telling you that if you enter in to the race even slightly dehydrated your performance is going to suffer.
Overdressing. Here is that dehydration issue. If you over dress for a marathon, you are likely going to sweat. Sweating on a cold day can lead to the chills ñ you will likely feel colder than if you had worn less. Sweating on a VERY hot day is going to cause you to sweat at a faster rate and cause dehydration faster than if you had dressed appropriately for the marathon. Itís hard to get blanket advice on what to wear for the marathon since we are all out there for different amounts of time and there is a HUGE difference between being out there running for 3 hours vs 4 hours vs 5 hours. I can say this from first hand experience, having run in the 3's the 4's and an almost 5 hour marathon {4:56}. My rule of thumb is get dressed ñ look in the mirror - take off something {gloves, hat, an extra layer or what not}
Starting out too fast. You canít make your marathon in the first mile but you can BREAK your marathon in the first mile. There are select few runners who can run an even pace for 26.2 miles {this girl comes to mind} but for the MAJORITY of us if you start out too fast, at or faster than your goal pace, you will hit the wall. There is science behind this, but basically you will be burning through your stored energy at a faster pace than if you started out slower and worked in to the faster pace. This will leave your muscles depleted earlier in the race. The wall can happen at different miles for different people ñ it typically is said it happens around mile 20 because that is when the average runner has used up the majority of their glycogen stores. The reality is though it depends on how much your body can store, has stored, and how fast it is burning through it. This is also where setting a realistic goal pace comes in to play and is extremely important. In the first miles of a marathon repeat PATIENCE to yourself and let people pass you. The first miles are not a time to compete with anyone, consider it a warm up {if you are an elite, then yes you may be competing in the first miles, but even elites have to practice patience in the beginning of the race}.
You didnít set a realistic goal and are paying the price. Itís awesome to have a DREAM BIG goal. Iím all about HUGE, SCARY goals, but at the end of the day you have to be realistic with what your body is capable of when it comes to the marathon, or it can make for a miserable day. When I first started running my goal every race was to Boston Qualify and run a sub 3:40 marathon ñ not only was I not in shape for a 3:40 marathon but I was running like a moron in the first miles and ALWAYS hit the wall. My first marathons basically turned in to run/walks ñ now I RUN a marathon ñ as in ñ not stopping for 26.2 miles. This is because I know how to pace myself better now. Your dream big race pace is likely going to feel easy in the first miles of a marathon. You have tapered, have fresh legs, and are feeding off the excitement of the day and of the crowds ñ this makes the early miles seem easy and you donít doubt for a second that you are running too fast. Then it hits and you realize that what you thought you were on pace for is drastically going to slow ñ in sets the disappointment and you arenít even close to the finish line. Once the mind is 
defeated the body follows and soon feels defeated itself. If your goal for the marathon is not realistic and even if you donít make the mistake of starting out too fast for that goal {say you start 30 seconds slower than goal race pace} you may still be going too fast for you in the early miles.
Iíll break this one down for you because I think itís EXTREMELY important when it comes to racing or running well in the marathon. You want to feel good when you finish, not terrible and in tears.
Say your DREAM BIG goal for the marathon is a 3:40 but a realistic goal based on your training is 3:59

a 3:40 marathon is an average of 8:24 per mile
a 3:59 marathon is an average of 9:09 per mile
Say you start your marathon out at 15 seconds slower than goal race pace at 8:39 which you believe to be starting out slow. It feels great because again you are tapered and a marathon should feel easy in the first miles. BUT your goal is not realistic and you should be starting out at 15 seconds slower than goal race pace for a 3:59 marathon and then kicking it in the last 6.2 miles if you feel good. Your pace in the early miles should be around a 9:24. HUGE difference between starting out at a 9:24 pace vs a 8:39 paceÖÖ.you start to feel crappy around mile 16 or so ñ thinking it will pass and by mile 20 you may be running a 9:30 pace. By mile 20 you are thinking about starting to walk ñ by mile 22 you may likely be run/walking. Your pace slows as you do the math in your head. At this point you may not even hit your realistic goal of 3:59 but an even slower goal as you see your pace slow down in to the 10's and beyond.  {These times are not precise ñ I am simply setting up a scenario for you so you fully get the importance of a realistic goal time in order to avoid hitting the wall} You are sad, miserable and though happy to be finished are disappointed that months of hard training led to this. Donít dump your time goal down the drain by starting out too fast ñ Iíve done it many a time ñ itís not fun knowing you are going to not only not hit your goal ñ but that you feel miserable and arenít enjoying the marathon in the process.

THIS doesnít have to happen. Set a realistic goal and then if you feel good in the middle of the race start picking it up each mile ñ you will likely be able to run under goal race pace for the second half of the marathon making up any time you thought you may have lost in the beginning.

This is how you surprise yourself and end up running close to your goal and even under your DREAM BIG goal.

What are some ìdonítsî that new ultrarunners should be wary of in terms of training/racing?

Roes: Donít put too much emphasis on one race (especially your first race). You are almost certain to run several more in the future. Have fun in your training and always be aware that your first ultra likely will not go exactly as plannedóno reason to take it all too seriously so as to avoid being too devastated when things donít go quite as well as you were hoping on race day. Run because you enjoy running, not exclusively to prepare for one particular race.

Powell: Donít go out as hard as you think [you should]. Go out at your planned effort and then back off another half click. Not only will that most likely be a more reasonable effort, itíll set you up to feel far better the final third of your race when itís far better to feel fresh, excited, and ready to go than to keep suffering more and more.

Smile at Your Critics
A few people will never miss a chance to tear running down, or jab its adherents in the chest with a rhetorical finger. Oddly enough, the most vocal of such critics are often in terrible health themselves.

"Bad for your joints," they'll jab.

"You'll get arthritis," they'll jab.

"Running marathons?" they'll ask, jabbingly, between sips of their Big Gulp. "That'll kill ya."

The best response is to continue running and loving it. Meantime, try inviting these critics to join you for a short run. Who knows? Maybe someday they'll accept your invitation.


if they become consistent runners who focus on performance gains, their bodies will become more efficientóand they wonít burn as many calories when running the same distance at the same pace.

What's so bad about going out too fast? It depends on the distance, says Foster. In a 5-K, you'll flood your muscles with by-products of burning glucose faster than your body is able to clear them, forcing you to slow. Go out too fast in a warm 10-K and you'll boost your core temperature too soon, making the last miles miserable. In a half or full marathon, you'll use up too much muscle glycogen early on, forcing your body to burn fat for fuel, which takes longer to convert to energy. Even during a training run, an overzealous start can leave you struggling to finish.What's so bad about going out too fast? It depends on the distance, says Foster.

Even during a training run, an overzealous start can leave you struggling to finish.


First 5 Miles:
Start out slow. When you start your half marathon, you'll feel strong and confident, but you have to tell yourself to hold back. Running your first half slower than the second half (called a negative split) is the key to running a smart and enjoyable half marathon. Take it slow. Your body will thank you during the later miles.
Run your own half marathon. Don't be worried if you see a lot of people passing you. Remember the tortoise and the hare? They may be starting out way too fast, so you'll catch them later—at your own pace. Going out too fast is one of the most common racing mistakes.
Here are some ways that you can avoid going out too fast:

Deliberately run your first mile slower than you plan to run the final one. It's tough to do, since
you'll most likely feel really strong in the beginning. But keep in mind that for every second you
go out too fast in the first half of your race, you could lose as much as double that amount of
time in the second half of your race.
Try to make sure you're in the correct starting position. Don't start yourself with faster runners


The marathon long run is overrated.

 In my experience, too many beginner runners, and those running slower than 3 hours and 45 minutes, focus on trying to squeeze multiple 20 or 22 mile runs into their training segment at the expense of improving more critical physiological systems. More importantly, scientific research has shown that runs of over 3 hours offer little additional aerobic benefit compared to runs of 2 hours, while significantly increasing injury risk.

 you should instead focus on improving your aerobic threshold, teaching your body to use fat as a fuel source, and building your overall tolerance for running on tired legs through accumulated fatigue.

 long run is such an ingrained element of marathon training, 


 Research has shown that your body doesnøt see a significant increase in aerobic development, specifically mitochondrial development, when running over 90 minutes. The majority of the physiological stimulus of a long run occurs between the 60 and 90 minute mark. This means that after running for 3 hours, aerobic benefits (capillary building, mitochondrial development) arenøt markedly better than when you run for only 2 hours. Therefore, a long run of over 3 hours isnøt building much more aerobic fitness than one lasting 2 hours.


 Furthermore, running for longer than 3 hours significantly increases your chance of injury. Your form begins to break down, your major muscles become weak and susceptible to injury, and overuse injuries begin to take their toll. This risk is more prevalent for newer runners whose aerobic capabilities (because of cross-training and other activities) exceed their musculoskeletal readiness. Basically, their bodies arenøt ready to handle what their lungs can.

Not only are aerobic benefits diminished while injury risk rises, recovery time is significantly lengthened. The total amount of time on your feet during a 3-hour plus run adds considerable fatigue to the legs, which leads to a significant delay in recovery time. In the long-term, this means you canøt complete the more marathon specific workouts, which I believe, and research has shown, are a more important component to marathon success.

why is the 20-miler so popular?

Second, the foundation for marathon training still comes from the 1970øs and 1980øs at the beginning of the running boom. Marathoning hadnøt quite hit the participation numbers it has today (you could sign up for most marathons, including Boston, the day before the race) and the average finishing time at most races was closer to 3 hours (today that number is over 4 hours). As such, the basis for how to train for a marathon came from runners who averaged close to 6 minutes per mile for the entire race. Therefore, 20 and 22 milers were common for these athletes, as a run of this distance would only take them about two-and-a-half hours to finish at an easy pace.

Moreover, the 20-mile distance is synonymous with øhitting the wallø or øbonkingø during the race itself. øHitting the wallø frequently occurs at 20 miles because your body can store, on average, two hours worth of glycogen (fuel) when running at marathon pace. Two hours for a 6-minute per mile marathoner occurs at almost exactly 20 miles.

In short, the basis for a lot of our understanding of marathon training is passed down from generation to generation without regard for the current paces of many of todayøs marathoners. Therefore, we also need to reassess where the long run fits into the training cycle and how we can get the most benefit from training week in and week out.

The million-dollar question still remains, however: How do you get your legs prepared to run for 26 miles? The answer lies in the theory of accumulated fatigue. By shortening your long run to 16 to 18-miles and buttressing it against a shorter, but steady paced run the day before, youøre able to simulate the fatigue youøll experience at the end of the race.


When I first started developing plans in the early 90s, times were different. People trained to run one or two marathons a year, and their focus was primarily on performance. When they started a training plan, it almost always began with a long run of 6-10 miles because they had a solid foundation of mileage and rarely ran a marathon as their first event. Back then, marathon training plans were around 16 weeks in duration. It was enough time to build on the mileage foundation, peak, and then taper down to race day.


Life is different in todayøs marathoning world. For one, the marathon (and half) is the carrot for new runners, some of whom have never run a race before. And two, runners are participating in marathons more frequently throughout the yearøsometimes every month! Both of which affect the optimal duration for a marathon training program.  


4. Running By Pace Rather Than Feel

The easiest way to bonk during a long run is to run it by a pace. Pace is only the outcome. It's not the target. When you run by feel (effort level) and stick with a conversation-pace effort, you'll always be in the right zone for that day. This is because there are a variety of things that affect performance and turn your normal easy 10:30 pace into a hard run.

Running on a very hot day will be much harder on the body. Lack of sleep, stress, training fatigue from other workouts and more can affect your performance. If the goal is to train in the easy effort so you can cover the distance and recover efficiently, you can't pin this running goal on a specific pace. Doing so can lead you to over training and under training and will rarely keep you in the optimal zone. Listen to your body, do a talk test, and stick within the easy zone when going the distance.




Lunch the day before the race: Penne pasta with grilled chicken and tomato sauce + 2 glasses of water
Dinner the day before the race (yes, I showed up to my pre-race dinner with my own food): Grilled chicken breast, plain baked potato with a ridiculous amount of salt, rice, 2 rolls, a salt pill before bed + lots of water
Pre-race breakfast (eaten 3 hours before the race start): 2 hard-boiled eggs, a bagel, half a banana, a salt pill and half a bottle of water
30 minutes before the race: 2 black cherry Clif Shot Bloks with a swig of water (I stop drinking water one hour before the race start.)
During the race: 5 GUs (3 salted caramel and 2 salted watermelon) around miles 3/4, 8, 12/13, 16/17 and 21; lots of Gatorade at the aid stations and water with all the GUs
After the race: Bottle of water, bottle of Gatorade and forced myself to eat a sandwich and some pretzels at the post-race party but had no appetite (you want to try to get a good mix of carbs and protein within 30 minutes of finishing)
Post-race indulgence: Fried pickles, a burger and fries and the best beers ever: Wellís Banana Bread, Rogue Nut Brown Ale and Smutty Nose Pumpkin
