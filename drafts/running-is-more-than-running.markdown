Running Is More Than Running (And Why I Run)

Eventually I reached a point where I was able to set a comfortable pace and just go, and that's when it became something completely different. It morphed from a drudgerous workout into something that I can only describe as physical meditation. I used to do Qigong a few times a week, and running produces the same meditative effect. When I'm out on a beautiful trail listening to the wind and the birds, focused on the rhythm of my breathing and foot movements, it's unbelievably peaceful and rejuvenating.
But it takes time to get there, and I think it's different for each individual. I was already in great shape from cycling. My body just needed to adjust. For anyone who's just getting started and struggles to push through a run, I'll say this: keep it up no matter what it takes. Once you reach the point where you're able to zone-out and just run, you'll wonder why it took you so long to get started. It's incredible.

Be conservative. The marathon is a long way. You will hurt and you will have doubts, but you will be able to keep moving forward. And get ready for the experience of a lifetime. You will never look at yourself the same after you finish. You will learn you are stronger than you ever realized.

I am so thankful for the amazing people I have met through running.  The running community is truly a special and powerful group of people and it has changed my life.  If it werenøt for running, I would never have met my wife, Sara, my kids, or many of my closest friends.  I am grateful for the places running has taken me.  Growing up in a big family, I hardly left California before I started running, but now Iøve traveled the world, raced in some of the most beautiful places in the world, and experienced many different cultures.  Running has taught me so many life lessons and helped shape me as a person.  These are the biggest rewards that will transcend my running career and serve me well for the rest of my life.  I am also thankful for my sponsors who have allowed me to pursue my sport to the highest level possible and provided the best product in the world to help me strive for my goals.  Without the support of my sponsors, family and friends, I wouldnøt be where I am today.

 

Running will always be a part of my life and now I look forward to helping others to reach their running goals, starting with my wife, who I am coaching for the upcoming Olympic Trials.  It has been fun for me to recently be beside her on the bike, encouraging her, seeing her grow, and even getting the same chills for her that I used to get when I was having a really good day out on the road.  I also hope that my running career has and will continue to lead to other peoplesø breakthroughs, both out on the road and in their hearts through participation in our Steps Foundation, running clinics, books, videos and just being a part of the amazing running community.

 

I will always look back at my running career with a smile on my face and thankfulness in my heart.  Many, many thanks to everyone who has cheered for me, encouraged me, and supported me on my journey.  I was never alone out on the race course.

Simply being able to run is the gift, not the time on the clock.

For people who donít enjoy running or havenít yet discovered its power, I know that may be hard to understand. But I promise you, running is not just running. Training and racing for a marathon is about finding out who you are on the inside and how much potential you have within you. Itís about the depth of the human spirit and the amount of heart you have to give. Itís about finding a way to keep going when you donít think thereís any way to continue. Itís about a drive to be your very best. Itís about conquering the impossible and finding strength you never knew you had. God, running is so much more than just running. On October 10, 2010, I was still learning that. I was a different runner when I showed up in Chicago to run 26.2 miles for the first time. There was so much I didnít yet know and didnít yet believe. I did a lot of things wrong and had a terrible race. I walked constantly after mile 15 and cried at the finish line in disappointment.

teaches you so many life lessons..


Thatís the beauty of the marathon. Itís so much more than just running. The marathon is where hard work and believing in yourself collide. It should be impossible. But we prove over and over again that we can do it.

You are stronger than you think.
Own this race.
You get to choose the outcome.
Breathe in strength. Breathe out weakness.

Fearless. Believe. Finish Strong..

No race recap or report can do justice to the emotional roller coaster ride you go on during a marathon and the depth of emotions, gratitude and strength you feel on the other side of a victorious day.

There will be good miles and bad miles. You donít know how many there will be or when they will occur. Just remember there will be another good mile ahead.

Running rewards hard work and commitment. It doesn't matter what your starting level of fitness or natural ability is; if you put in the training you will see massive improvements in terms of general fitness and performance. The key to success is consistency, so stick at it.
I've been a runner for 3 years now..Parenting Precept #3: Encourage the ability to question anything labeled ‚Äúimpossible.‚Äù

I actually haven‚Äôt read this advice in any parenting book, but it‚Äôs an extremely high priority among the messages I want to convey to my children. Essentially this: The world only changes for the better when someone who doesn‚Äôt know something is impossible (or refuses to believe it) comes along and does it.

More than anything, running long distances has taught me that what seems impossible ‚Äî not for mankind, but just for me, personally ‚Äî isn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs what the first marathon, then qualifying for Boston, then running 50 miles and then running a hundred were all about for me.

And I‚Äôm guessing that in most cases, this heroic thwarting of the impossible is what running is about for others, too.

The first time my kids run a mile, a 5K will seem impossible. Just like it did for me. So will every other distance.

The sooner I can help them to see that it‚Äôs not, the better.

Because if that turned out to be possible, then who knows what else might be?



Know It All Helps
It hurts like the dickens, leaves you crashed on the couch or side of the road, and makes you wish for the icy cold hand of winter. Yet working out in this weather, if done right, will make you a better runner. It‚Äôll make that cool, crisp fall morning where you put on your bib number all the more savory.

Remember that much we do as runners is, or should be, delayed gratification. We put in the hard work and effort when others won't so we can achieve the things others cannot. The sacrifices we make in these not-so-prime months will pay dividends in the future.

If you want that first sub-four-hour marathon or the first sub-20-minute 5K, the summer is where those dreams are made.



I absolutely love the process of challenging myself every day, seeing improvement, and I love to compete.

But I especially like my hard workout days when I get to push myself and see what I can achieve.  I love tangible improvement so Iøm always trying to run faster than I did last week.
