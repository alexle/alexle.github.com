Car sharing companies see the future in a similar way. Turo also expects car ownership to decline as more people rent or share vehicles. But ownership will not disappear. Instead, those who own cars will be able to maximize the return on their investment, which means the car will no longer be a depreciating asset sitting in their driveway.

“There will be less car ownership,” says Steve Webb, a spokesman for Turo. “But the ownership will be more economically sound.”

Travelers are cooling to wasteful car ownership

The most interesting shift, though, is happening on the consumer side — which, in a sense, is the only one that really matters. As the Arity survey suggested, drivers are unhappy with the way they use their cars. I spend all day listening to drivers through my nonprofit consumer advocacy site, and I hear the same thing.

If I could sum up their frustrations, here’s how I would put it: They’re tired of feeling as if they have to buy the latest model, which looks an awful lot like last year’s model. They feel as if having the vehicle sit in their driveway, regularly demanding tributes of car insurance, maintenance and taxes, is a waste of money and resources. They believe there are more efficient, less expensive, ways of getting around.

And they don’t want to buy a new car.

My attitude toward mobility has changed, too. I spent almost an entire year without a car and relied on rentals and car sharing to get from point “A” to point “B.” It felt liberating. At the end of the year, I tried to sign up for one of the vehicle subscription services, but they were not available in Arizona at the time.

I now own a Honda CR-V. I’m sure it will be my last car.

Why you shouldn’t buy a new car

So what, exactly, will the future look like for transportation? Is it a network of autonomous cars that you pay for per use? A collection of cars that are owned by individuals, but available for sharing? A fleet of rental vehicles to which you could subscribe? It could be all of these — or a combination of them — that define your future transportation options.


No one knows what the future of transportation will look like, only that it will be radically different from today. It isn’t really a question of what will happen, but when.

All of which brings us back to the original question — should you buy a new car or not? Having spoken with many transportation experts, and watching how consumers have changed the way they think about mobility, I would carefully consider any purchasing decision. Self-driving vehicles are just around the corner, and they represent a quantum leap in automotive technology. Electric vehicles are close to going mainstream, too. Buying a new car now might be an investment in old technology unless you plan to turn your car into a revenue-generating machine through a platform like Turo.

Maybe this is a good year to wait and see what will happen next.

“We are on the verge of a major industry transformation, and how we travel will change significantly,” says Kevin Oates, managing director of the communication firm Ketchum’s transportation team. “The question is the timeline.”

Are Americans falling out of love with the automobile?

Attitudes toward driving are shifting, too. A new survey by Arity, a mobile technology company, suggests people aren’t as tied to their cars, and to car ownership, as they once were. Drivers spend an average of only 6.7 hours per week driving, clocking an average of only 107 miles per week. Fully one-third of drivers say the amount of time they spend sitting in the car is “very frustrating,” and more than half say they would rather spend time doing more productive tasks than driving.
