Colfax Marathon 2014 Race Report
06-01-2015


This post is a little a lot overdue and it is VERY long (sorry, not sorry?!). To be honest, I’m not sure why it took me so long to finally sit down and write this. It was a great experience, one I am very excited to share. I think part of my delay has to do with not knowing how I could possibly capture the amazingness I experienced that weekend in words, but here goes…



When I talked to my dad after the race he was very congratulatory and told me, sometimes the marathons to be most proud of are not the PRs but the ones you finished, despite the conditions. 


 the negative thoughts, but remember thinking, why don’t I just train for half marathons? DAMMIT I SHOULD JUST DO HALF MARATHONS. Or 5Ks. 5ks sound awesome.


That the race medal is not always an award for time but an award for overcoming obstacles. 

h
t won't apply to absolutely everybody, but the open secret of marathons is that nearly everybody is physically capable of doing it. It's not a massive feat of strength; it's just a willingness to keep on moving. Many people could walk 26.2 miles right now, if they absolutely had to.

you almost have to become a PR-seeker to continue earning that wonderful feeling of satisfaction you can only get from walking through the finish chute thinking, I ran absolutely as hard as I could. I faced the pain and the doubt and I did not back down one inch.

The obstacles we face make us stronger. At the same time, grateful for all the challenges because it makes us *stronger*. Just like any 

priviledge to have a body that can run

go into knowing that i gave it every ounce i possibly could

no, no, no.... not now



No one else in the group really paid him any mind and he didn't care either. This guy was on a mission. From the very beginning I could tell that this man was digging into the depths of his soul to keep pace with the laminated sign I was holding high. I never found out what his motivation was but I guess I didn't need to either. I had been in his shoes and know exactly what kind of suffering he is willingly putting himself through. I guess it was everyone's ultimately goal but this guy wanted it more and it was probably just on the threshold of his ability.



The whole group kept it together pretty well and we laughed and joke about pretty much anything along the way but about every 9minutes things would get ridiculously serious and the intention of the race would refocus as all the watches would ring off the mile semi-simultaneously. It was this check-in that kept me super motivated throughout the race. This is when everyone made it clear that they were counting on me to get them in on time. I don't quite know how to put in to words how importance everyone made me feel that they were on pace. This damn paper sign just kept getting heavier. One woman even said to me around mile 5 as I shifted to the middle of the road, "You can't move too much like that because I will get too nervous if I am far away from you." Everyone here had been training for months and it was really amazing the amount of trust they placed in me, a complete stranger with a stupid smile on his face and corny running jokes holding a dumb sign, to make (or break) their race.


I'm not gonna lie. The last few miles are awful.

When I think back to UTMB last year, the first image that comes to mind is not crossing the finish line. It's certain moments along the trail that I hold dearest. 

Panicking After A Bad Workout
You are going to have a really bad workout in training. In fact, you’re probably going to have a few. Unfortunately, even when you know this, a bad workout is still damaging to the psyche. You start to question your fitness. Are you working too hard? Not hard enough? Will you be ready for race day?

The result of this over thinking is that you panic, which usually results on you doing something stupid, like trying to make up the workout the next day or running extra hard during your next session to “make up” for the bad day.

However, this is one of the biggest mistakes you can make. It almost always results in overtraining, injury and will have detrimental, compounding effect on all your upcoming workouts.
