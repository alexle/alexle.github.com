Our The Need For Stuff
05-18-2017

is owning stuff still cool?“

We all have stuff that we need and want and love in our lives, and stuff that’s hanging around our homes because it’s junk that we haven’t yet realized is junk. For Marie Kondo, asking “Does this spark joy?” is the way to tell the difference. If that doesn’t work for you, try these questions instead:

Would I wrestle this out of Marie Kondo’s arms if she tried to take it away?
Kondo doesn’t actually do this; she’s very clear in her books that these decisions are personal and that you should not let anybody else’s rules override what you know in your heart.

But she also once wrote that if a client is having trouble deciding whether to keep something, she suggests that it be discarded. It’s a test: If they object, the item stays, no questions asked.

If I were moving across the country, would this be worth the trouble and expense of bringing it with me?
If you’ve done a big move, you know this one: the closer you are to your move-out date, the fewer things in your life spark enough joy to be worth packing up, labeling, hauling, and finding a new place for.

No need to actually move anywhere to put this rule to use. An imaginary relocation will do.

It’s about quality, not quantity. You don’t have to get rid of things just because they don’t get used often. The KonMari method isn’t a minimalist challenge; it’s about keeping things in your home that you truly treasure.

What would I do if I needed this and didn’t have it?
I find this rule helpful for being honest with myself about duplicates. If I didn’t have this particular tote bag, I would use one of my other 15. On the other hand, I might not wear a business suit very often, but I’d hate to have to run out and buy one on the next rare occasion I truly needed it.

Have I used this in the past year?
With the exception of a few special-purpose things (like that emergency business suit), if you haven’t worn an outfit in the past year it probably doesn’t need to be taking up space in your closet. Same goes for kitchen gear and pretty much anything that’s meant to be useful. Those spare bedsheets you kind of hate? If you’ve gotten along fine without them all year, you can probably let them go.

Our tech editor David Murphy says that when he finds cables or electronics accessories, he asks himself, “How many devices do I have that support this?” If the answer is none, it should probably go.






	I’m not going to tell you to go to the gym or volunteer at the soup kitchen instead of shopping. Instead, shop your house. The cans of soup in the cupboard that you keep around but haven’t eaten—why not have one for lunch? You have books you haven’t read, clothes you’ve barely worn, apps you’ve barely used. And if you’re lucky, you got a few new things for the holidays that should keep you occupied. A friend recently remarked that for every new thing you buy, it makes everything you already own a little less valuable. This really stuck with me, and helps when I’m tempted to buy something I don’t need. I want, as we all do, to be less attached to things. I’d rather have fewer things that I value, than a load of crap that I only kind of like. This is not a new bit of wisdom, but one that’s worth meditating on a little while you’re not spending. You don’t have to get rid of your actual clutter in your home, but once you start using the things you have, you’ll naturally discover which things you value and which you can let go. More importantly, when you’re not in constant pursuit of the next acquisition, you rid yourself of the exhausting “mental clutter” that attends consumerism.






benefits of owning less clothes:

- more income
- less stress getting ready in the morning
- packing would be easier
- closets would be more organized
- laundry easier
- more time and energy to live life you want


In America, we consume twice as many material goods as we used to 50 years ago. Over the same period, the size of the average American home has nearly tripled, and today that average home contains about 300,000 items.

Most homes contain more televisions than people. About 25 percent of two-car garages don’t have room to park even one car inside them, and still one out of every 11 American households rents off-site storage—the fastest-growing segment of the commercial real estate industry over the past four decades. Meanwhile, home organization, trying to find places for all our excess belongings, is now an $8 billion industry.

We’re at material overload and it isn’t fun like it looks in the commercials.





Ten years ago, I decided to embrace minimalist living.

I was spending too much of my life caring for possessions and I was wasting too much money managing and accumulating things I didn’t need. Those possessions were not bringing me joy or lasting happiness. They were keeping me from the very things that did.

Possessions had become the great distraction in my life. And the best way to recenter myself on the things that mattered most was to remove the excess from my home.

Since then, I’ve been asked countless times if I think minimalism is just a phase. I always answer the same, “Absolutely not. Never underestimate the importance of abandoning crap you don’t need. It has the power to change your life dramatically."

Intentionally owning less is a better way to live. It brings freedom, clarity, and opportunity. And each of us should consider embracing it in our own unique way. Consider these seven reasons:








It’s easy to think that life gets easier when you have more clothes, shoes, accessories, and options in general to choose from. However, backpacking taught me that this couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, I quickly learned that once I limited the stuff I brought along with me on my journey, I was able to completely focus on things that actually matter in life. Life’s simple pleasures bring so much joy, and I was able to experience that first-hand. This style of travel introduced me to a new way of living, and I’m so glad I gave it a try.




3. Time and health matter more than wealth. Cornelius Vanderbilt’s son William was far and away the richest person in the world after doubling the inheritance given to him by his late father in just 6 years. But the burden of wealth brought him nothing but anxiety. He spent all of his time managing his substantial wealth through the family’s businesses, which meant he had no time to enjoy his money or take care of his body.

He once said of a neighbor who didn’t have as much money, “He isn’t worth a hundredth part as much as I am, but he has more of the real pleasures of life than I have. His house is as comfortable as mine, even if it didn’t cost so much; his team is about as good as mine; his opera box is next to mine; his health is better than mine, and he will probably outlive me. And he can trust his friends.”

William also told his nephew, “What’s the use, Sam, of having all this money if you cannot enjoy it? My wealth is no comfort to me if I have not good health behind it.”

All the money in the world doesn’t matter if you don’t have the time or the health to enjoy it.


And so, upon hearing the word “minimalism”, many think of owning only a few pieces of clothing, a tiny house with nothing but a mattress and zero waste.
This couldn’t be further away from the truth.
Minimalism has little to do with stuff. Things are just a by-product of a mindset. Minimalism is about mindset.
It’s about living with intention. You make room — space and time — for the things you love and eliminate everything that distracts us from them.
You become intentional with what you choose to do and own and how it impacts your way of living, thinking, and perspective on life.
“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” — Leonardo da Vinci
To add value to life, think subtraction. Think of what you can remove.
Less is more.



Stop Buying Possessions, Start Buying Experiences
I admit that I’m biased as a minimalist, but it’s hard to deny hard data—experiences have been shown to make us happier than material possessions. The linked study from Cornell says, “Consumers spend more time thinking about material purchases they didn’t choose than they spend when they buy an experience.”

It appears that experiences are free from the comparison mindset that can sour an item purchase. A year later, your phone is outdated, but your trip to Rome isn’t - instead it ages like wine in your mind. I went to Rome in May and my $800 Galaxy Note II was stolen. I haven’t missed my phone at all, but will remember the trip forever.

When it comes to spending money, experiences are almost always a better value than possessions. As I have said before: “Things have a ‘pay once and use for years’ value appeal over an experience’s one-time nature. I get that. But it’s a value trap—as we say in the investing world - because time of use is not an accurate measure of value. If I licked a rock for 40 years, you wouldn’t call the rock valuable, would you?”

Important lesson: Material possessions tend to make us happy initially and then wane off considerably, but the happiness gained from experiences may last a lifetime. If you want to be happier in the long term, consider buying plane or concert tickets instead of a TV or new phone.



Most people mistake being rich for owning lots of stuff or achieving some sort of fame or status. I could max out my credit card buying VIP tables in Vegas all weekend and take selfies with Ivanka Trump, but that doesn’t make me rich. On the contrary, it would make me kind of a douchebag.

There is that old saying from Fight Club, “The things you own end up owning you.” Materialism, by and large, is a psychological trap. No matter how much you own, how much you buy, how much you earn, the disease of more never goes away. Meanwhile, you’re working longer hours, taking bigger risks, foregoing more and more parts of your life.


“My wife thinks I’m obsessed with money. However, as an accountant I have a pretty good idea where our finances are going and I think we will be in a great spot within the next 10 years.” This man is starting early: He’s only 25.

“I want us as a family to have the money to go places, do things and enjoy life,” he adds. “I like to have a cushion so if something comes up ...we can do it no questions asked. I’d rather spend money on experiences and enjoying life. My wife, on the other hand, wants new cars, big houses and stuff. I feel she doesn’t understand how expensive things are.”



There are two ways to be rich: One is by acquiring much, and the other is by desiring little.
 — Jackie French Koller You are making an investment every time you choose NOT to buy something. The investment is in yourself. By saving and investing that money, you shorten the time it takes to reach real freedom.

People say that we don’t own possessions, but rather that they own us. I can tell you that this is true. When you own more, you need more. You also have more stress thinking about all you have to lose. It is a terrible cycle that is hard to stop. My hope for you is that you see this earlier than I did and never get on the hamster wheel.





swept up in the rat race, itch for more never goes away. once i reach this goal, i need to shoot for next .. never stopped to question, is this fulfilling me, what do I really need to be happy


Gone are the days where your self-worth was determined by the size of your house and the make of your car. While some vestiges of the past still cling to those status symbols, we “oddball millennials” have learned a thing or two from the 2008 financial crisis. As we watched the material monarchy of our parents get washed away like sandcastles against the financial undertow, we learned how fleeting material possessions can be.

While I’m no guru (and most millennials wouldn’t call themselves that either), it’s pretty clear that we define our lives by the experiences we have. We make purchases that lead to life experiences we can cherish (or learn from) for a lifetime. Many of us travel while others just like going out and having a great time with friends. And rarely does a card like the Chase Sapphire Reserve® come along and actually reward what millennials value most: a life filled with meaning rather than a life filled with things.




11. A car is a distraction whether you like it or not.

Washing it.
Scratches.
Petrol.
Storing it.

The same goes for many material possessions which suck up time that you could be using to crush your goals.

I look forward to the day where we can all easily access a shared electric car. Cars are a distraction that rarely bring joy.




As Will Rogers once said, I had become busy “spending money I hadn’t earned, to buy things I didn’t want, just to impress people I didn’t like.”

However, once introduced to the idea of minimalism, choosing to intentionally live with less sounded surprisingly attractive.

My decision found its roots in my finances, my family, and my faith. I had grown weary of living paycheck to paycheck, weary of trading time with my kids to manage my stuff, and weary of pursuing worldly gain rather than lasting purpose.

Owning less offered escape from the clutter in my home. But more than that, it offered escape from the clutter in my life. It reintroduced intentionality and alignment. And it offered the very ideals my heart most desperately desired. Since choosing minimalism, I have experienced numerous benefits. I have more time, more energy, more freedom, and more money to pursue what is most important to me. Owning less means less cleaning, less burden, less anxiety, and less stress every day. I have found more opportunity to pursue my greatest passions.

Over the years, I have come to define minimalism as the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of everything that distracts us from it. I have found minimalism to be a lifestyle that appeals to the heart and resonates with the soul. It may look different from person to person, but I have seen it adopted all over the world by individuals in every stage of life.



The more you want, the more you feel like you’re missing, and the poorer you’ll be in your own mind.

I like to think of life as a drinking glass, and water as the things you want and need in life. Happiness and contentedness—what Seneca calls “enough”—is when your glass is filled to the brim with water. The more you want, however, the larger your glass has to be, and that means it will take you more water to fill your glass and achieve happiness. Moreover, you’ll spend your life hating the fact your glass isn’t full, when you could have spent your energy finding ways to actually fill it. On the other hand, if you have a small glass, it takes very little water to fill it, and that makes it much easier to reach that state of contentedness.

At the very least, reevaluate your wants. Trim them down realistically, prioritize them, and define your version of “enough,” the things you really need to be happy. Stop wallowing at your lot in life and focus on how you can get those things. Better yet, to stop feeling so poor, stop wanting so much. After all, if you have nothing and want nothing, you’ve got all you need.




“Learning to live with less will create space in your life for the things that truly matter to you”

honest with yourself: do you really need that object? If the answer is no, free some space up in your life. What Seneca says here is the reason I have personally given away and sold most of my possessions. I’ve never been happier.

Practice poverty.
Especially during prosperous times in your life, the Stoics believe you should practice poverty. This is how you prepare for hardship and become an expert in dealing with the ups and downs of life. Comfort can become a form of slavery because you consistently start to think that someone could take away what you have.

When you’re familiar with what you fear, it no longer controls you. The worst can happen and you go through it with a sense of calmness and ease. People think you’re resilient but actually, you’ve just practiced the hard times as preparation.

Quick tip: try eating a really cheap meal for a whole week every two months. Eat like you have almost no money. This will teach you to not only appreciate the nice meals but to be okay if you ever face poverty and have to live on very little money for a while. I know a few people that do a beans and rice meal for this week of living it rough. Try it!

You protect everything you have, why not your mind?
You don’t give away your wallet to a stranger on the street. You don’t hand the keys to your car over to a budding thief. You wouldn’t let your house be demolished by the council without a fight. So why would you hand over the keys to your mind so easily to any stranger who wants them?

You have to become aware of who you are unconsciously giving your mind over to. You need to realize who is influencing you in a negative way without knowing it.

“Your mind can create all the abundance you could ever imagine, so you need to protect it like it’s the only possession you have”
Don’t wreck the purpose of your life by trying to impress others.
The Stoics teach that the opinions of people you seek our to impress are not that great themselves. These people you seek to impress have addictions, their own problems, and are no wiser than the next person. The purpose of your life is not to impress people and doing so will have the opposite effect.

Focus on impressing yourself through personal growth and wisdom from people who serve the greater good. Go beyond yourself and avoid the need to seek approval. Take action and seek forgiveness later if you must.

Rich people spend like they're poor and poor people spend like they're rich.



People won’t remember what you’re wearing.
There’s this myth that we have to wear something new all of the time. The harsh reality is that most people won’t remember what you’re wearing anyway because they’re so focused on their own appearance and problems.

None of us need as many clothes as we have. Culling the size of your wardrobe will save you lots of money.

"Stop driving a car you can't afford to impress people at the stop light that you'll never meet"



Learn to let things go

While there is nothing wrong with owning material goods, having less stuff is a sure way to reduce stress. There is a famous quote from the movie Fight Club that goes: “the things you own end up owning you.” I couldn’t have found this to be more true while on the road. Due to the nature of my lifestyle, I would lose, break, or misplace my possessions all the time. Keeping track of and trying to protect all of my belongings caused me a lot of distress – and I only had a carry-on of them!

My life got significantly easier and stress-free when I reduced the meaning I assigned to my possessions. There are very few goods that cannot be replaced, and those that are irreplaceable are probably not what I’d want to take with me on the road. I got rid of items that I was not constantly using, I purchased cheaper items that I could “afford” to lose, and made a conscious effort to feel less attached to what I owned.

The result was a sense of freedom that I hadn’t experienced before: I was hardly affected when stuff inevitably got damaged, I lost interest in acquiring new items, and I had less to think about and account for. The relief was both physical – I had less weight to carry – and mental.




Psychologists call this "hedonic adaptation." In other words, the excitement of that new car, iPhone or furniture set will quickly fade into the background as they become a part of our daily lives. Experiences, like traveling, attending an art exhibit or trying a new restaurant become a part of our identity, which brings us greater satisfaction.

“Our experiences are a bigger part of ourselves than our material goods,” says Gilovich. “You can really like your material stuff. You can even think that part of your identity is connected to those things, but nonetheless they remain separate from you. In contrast, your experiences really are part of you. We are the sum total of our experiences.”  Happiness over material items quickly fades.

“One of the enemies of happiness is adaptation,” says Dr. Gilovich. “We buy things to make us happy, and we succeed. But only for a while. New things are exciting to us at first, but then we adapt to them.”








When I as worked as a Wall Street investment adviser, I quickly learned that people who have tons of money most often don’t look like it. They don’t have to. So who are the big shots wearing the fancy suits and driving the Porsches? Often it’s the people who make a living selling stuff to the rich people.

I can’t remember the last time I wore a fancy suit. I’ve never owned a new car, and I live in a house that’s worth about a third of what I could afford.

Diverting your investable cash into things like cars, clothing, vacations and houses you can’t afford will make you look rich now, but prevent you from actually becoming rich later.


ah, the American Dream: You work hard, get a good job, start a family, buy a house and then, when you're done with that house, you buy a bigger one. You accumulate wealth in your home and then pass that wealth on to your children, who will be better off than you.



I don't have many wants in life..


And that�s when the warp of the world ensnared me. Caught me right between its teeth from the scuff of my shirt and snarled,�How come you want no big house, no cars, no living rooms filled with fancy objects that stay poised but don�t offer much?�

I blinked hard. Slowly, I found my voice.

I crave a slow life. A simple life.

II. Relentlessly eliminate.


�Our life is frittered away by detail. Simplify, simplify.�� Henry David Thoreau


The world is noisy. The less you have, the better you can focus on the signal.

Simplify your commitments and your relationships. It�s not about trimming down for the sake of trimming down. It�s about strategically choosing less.



Typical American homes are now double the size they were 1950s, we drive fancier cars, and fill our closets to the brim with unworn clothes. Many have even accumulated credit card debt from buying all these things. We�ve been buying more stuff than ever because it brings us instant gratification. And yet, we�re not any happier in the long run. In fact, studies show that consumerism has made us less happy and more miserable.

Minimalism and happiness
But, how exactly can minimalism make us happier? �Minimalism in of itself doesn�t make you happier. It�s a means to an end. What it does is frees up our most finite resources. It frees up time, money, energy, and removes stress. It frees up all of these resources that you can now start investing in what brings you purpose. The pursuit of happiness is empty. We find happiness when we find purpose, a life of fulfillment, and our greatest passion,� Joshua explains.

�Minimalism frees up our most finite resources.� �Joshua Becker




I have long been a believer in living simply. You don�t need the stuff to make you happy. You need to concentrate on the important things in your life such as loving relationships, family time and your passions.

1. Clear your wardrobe

Take everything out of your wardrobe and pile it on the bed. Create 3 piles; things to go to charity, to sell or to the bin. Anything you haven�t worn in the past 6 months goes straight to one of the piles. Work your my way through each item, asking yourself whether you really need it. The rest goes back into the wardrobe, sectioned off into each type of clothing. Less choice means less time spent thinking about what to wear.

�I want to clear my life to make it so that I have to make as few decisions as possible about anything except how to best serve this community,�



have talked extensively about our disdain for owning a car, forking over a monthly payment for a depreciating asset, and dealing with all the random costs and annoyances that come with owning a car.

OF COURSE I�M NOT GOING TO FIX IT.  If the repair is cosmetic, will not impact the life of my asset, and will be expensive, why on earth would I spend the money?  It hit me a while ago and my feelings about it have accelerated a lot recently�but who really cares about the appearance of your car?  Who cars if there is a dent?  I have driven it plenty of times for work and I have not had one co-worker or client complain to me.  In my opinion, this repair is a sunk cost.  It is funny, I feel like I would be angrier looking at my repaired bumper that cost thousands of dollars to fix versus a dented bumper that I never had to repair.

When I was making my decision, I realized what was most important to me.  To me, I would rather save as much as possible and keep on growing my dividend income or paying down our student loans.  Focus on building assets that appreciate in value or focus on relieving yourself of expensive debt.   That�s the name of the game and we say it every time here�EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS.   Every thousand dollars I spent repairing my car was about $30-$50 less in annual dividend income going forward.  This repair could have cost me triple digit dividend income if the repair were as expensive as my mom�s boyfriend was describing it to be and I would be that much farther away from achieving my dividend income goals for the year.   That is a trade-off I was not willing to take.  Not for a cosmetic flaw in an asset that I barely want to own.   That my friends, is why I am never going to repair that ugly, eyesore of a dent in my car!


If you�re having a hard time deciding which stuff in your basement you should get rid of, ask yourself, �Would I buy this again today?� If you wouldn�t, it might be time to get rid of it.



What can you stop doing, stop needing, and stop buying? As I progress in my journey of lifelong frugality, I�ve come to realize that one of the things I value most about this lifestyle is the simplicity it delivers.
I�ve learned that in many instances, I�m able to simultaneously save money and simplify my life. This gives me more time, less stress, and a more genuine appreciation for the small wonders of my daily routine. Oh and hey! I save tons of money in the process.


There�s more to life than buying stuff.



Szuszkiewicz is part of an anti-consumerist movement, known as minimalism or mindful consumerism, that has been sweeping across the globe via blogs, self-help books and social media. This move towards buying less often attracts new converts during the festive season when people balk at the scale of Christmas spending.

Like many minimalists he now values time over money. �I think the best gift you can give someone is time, when you are genuinely fully present. Step off the treadmill of rushing around earning money to pay for stuff and you find life goes much slower. I have so much more time now to do the things I love doing � and not just at Christmas, but all year-round. I feel liberated,� Boyle says.

Szuszkiewicz feels the same way. �You experience this huge release and liberation from cultural norms when you stop spending, especially at Christmas. I used to feel obligated to spend money I didn�t have on gifts I didn�t know whether my family needed or wanted. Now, everyone knows my policy is to not buy any gifts, so I no longer feel that obligation and I enjoy Christmas much more,� he said.

Szuszkiewicz is currently using the �24,000 he saved over his no-spend year to travel around the world, and owns no possessions other than those he carries in his backpack. But he doesn�t want anything for Christmas.

�Physical things are literally a burden for me � and that�s not what Christmas means to me anymore. It�s about being with the people I love.�

He acknowledges that he makes a choice not to spend, rather than being forced into that position by circumstance. �But I think there�s nothing wrong with living this way, if you do have a choice. Why should you buy stuff that you don�t need to buy, just because you have more money to spend than other people?�

�When I was doing my no-spend year and I thought back to past Christmases, I realised I couldn�t remember what I got, but I could remember where I was and who I was with,� she says. �Now, instead of stressing about buying presents, I place more importance on relaxation and family time and I look forward to Christmas much more.�

 I�m not against consumption � I�m just against mindless consumption, and consumption one can�t afford. I�ve realised I already have all I want or need.�






Money isn�t the issue. The 36-year-old editor has made a conscious lifestyle choice, joining a growing number of Japanese deciding that less is more.

Influenced by the spare aesthetic of Japan�s traditional Zen Buddhism, minimalists buck the norm in a fervently consumerist society by dramatically paring back their possessions.

Sasaki, once a passionate collector of books, CDs and DVDs, became tired of keeping up with trends two years ago.

�I kept thinking about what I did not own, what was missing,� he says.

He spent the next year selling possessions or giving them to friends.

�Spending less time on cleaning or shopping means I have more time to spend with friends, go out, or travel on my days off. I have become a lot more active,� he says.






Consider the benefits of living in a smaller home: less expense, less worry, less upkeep�more time, more money, more freedom, and more opportunity.

When we first began pursuing minimalism, we made a lot of changes in our home. We removed the excess from every room in our house. But when we began removing entire rooms from our home, we started to experience even more significant benefits.

Four years ago, we intentionally decided to buy a smaller house. Our mortgage payments were sliced in half. Our insurance and taxes were also lowered. Our energy bills were slashed. Our ongoing repair and maintenance is a fraction of the expense it was before. And our cleaning responsibilities are noticeably easier.




People sometimes look at me quizzically when I proclaim that I don�t need more stuff, and that I�m constantly getting rid of what I do have.

What kind of weirdo is this? Why would you want less stuff?

Less is better.

Less means you spend less. You need less storage. You need a smaller house.

Less means you worry less. You search for things less. You are less bogged down by clutter.

Less means you�re lighter. You�re freer. You can focus on better things.

Less means you can travel more quickly. You spend less time with stuff, and more time doing stuff.



It also bugs me that high spending is still considered a desirable thing, and that living on less money is assumed to come with a reduction in happiness. When really, measuring life by your spending level is like judging a town by the size of its parking lots. Is your goal to maximize the amount of asphalt and SUVs you can spread out across the land, or would you rather just get into that damned grocery store so you can get yourself some nice stuff for dinner?

Spending is a skill: a Mustachian can buy the same lifestyle with $25,000 that might cost a Consumer Sucka $100,000 per year. If you can cultivate this skill, the Art of the 75% reduction, at any income level, you can go from a lifetime of being in debt, to being rich enough to retire in less than 10 years. Similarly, a company that can operate with this level of skill will quickly become the most successful company in history, and a similarly efficient government would find the world sitting peacefully in its palm.





We need to stop and ask ourselves � what is it all for? Why are we working so hard in order to buy so much, to have so much, to be burdened and cluttered by so much?

It�s just too much. Minimalists say, �I�m getting off this merry-go-round. I opt out.�



He said he doesn�t care about buying the biggest boat or having the fanciest house or even the bragging rights that come with wealth. He simply works to afford a happy, worry-free life.

�For me, personally, I want to be free from all these material possessions and I want to be free from debt and I want to share that message with our audience,� said Eric.

In a world that�s all about scaling and competition, Eric remains focused on making enough to live modestly. That�s it. Of course, he wants to stay profitable so his business can continue to exist, but it�s not profit at all costs. He�d rather add value to people�s lives and to his own.

To me, freedom is more flexibility. To Eric, freedom means living a life without debt and material distractions. To you, freedom might be more time with your family.

Freedom means something different for everyone. Define what it means to you, and you may find it changes everything about the way you work and think about money & success.


We�re all victims in the race to gain more status. Society pressures us to have a bigger house, a nicer car, and more toys. If your rush to gain status starts with buying stuff, however, you might want to rethink your strategy.

As personal finance site Done by Forty explains, buying status symbols is rarely correlated with an actual increase in status. You can look like you�re better off, but in reality you�re making your financial situation worse without improving your life much. Especially if those purchases put you in debt.



There�s a great scene in The Dark Knight where the Joker shares his life�s philosophy:

�I just do things.�

Now, for all of Joker�s flaws (terrorist, mass murderer, armed robber, political assassin � but we�ll overlook that for now), he does have a point here.



All across the nation, families are struggling to get ahead. For some, the rising costs of healthcare chip away at their gains. For others, stagnating wages and college bills are a real problem.

Then there are those who claim raising kids makes it impossible to grow wealth.

No matter where you go, you�ll hear stories of hardship � many of which are out of our control. But, what if I told you some financial pain in this country is self-inflicted? What if I told you one financial decision in particular has been absolutely catastrophic for people at every income?

The average car payment in US is now $499. That is straight up stupid. That much invested would be over $5M at retirement. According to a recent State of the Automotive Finance Study from Experian, the average new car payment reached $499 per month last quarter. Worse, the average new car loan is 68 months long! Like my man Dave Ramsey says, it�s entirely preposterous when you really think about it. Have you ever imagined what you could do with an extra $499 per month? We blame our employers for not giving us the raises we deserve, or our parents for not educating us enough. We blame health insurance premiums, the price of groceries, the housing market, and even the price of gas. But, do we ever throw shade at our car payments? Heavens no. Somewhere along the line, we�ve become socially conditioned to believe a huge car payment is a fact of life. We tell ourselves that everyone has a car payment, and that it�s normal and okay. And heck, if we�re going to have a car payment, we might as well get the car we want, right? and it�s killing our wealth.

it all boils down to poor planning � and a lack of awareness. As Minnesota Financial Advisor Jamie Pomeroy notes, people are conditioned to gauge affordability based on a monthly payment � not on the overall costs of a car or even the long-term financial consequences. People tend to think, �I can afford this monthly payment� without asking themselves the right questions. In reality, we should be asking ourselves if we can truly afford a $30,000+ car that will depreciate the second we pull off the lot


3. Forgoing the American dream

It's interesting to me how many young people have redefined the American dream for themselves. It's no longer about the white picket fence and the big backyard. It's about freedom--the freedom to explore, to do what you love. Young people realize that real freedom is, in a sense, having less. It's about creating a lifestyle, not taking on a bunch of debt and a mortgage.

However, this, too, can be difficult for older generations to understand. They see the new dream as a matter of a young person just not knowing what they want.

On the contrary. We know exactly what we want. And it is not found on 927 W. Drury Lane.

One of the easiest personal finance tips out there is to simply stop wanting more stuff. It�s simple, but it�s true�if you had an easy way to basically eliminate your desire to acquire anything new aside from things to cover your barest needs, personal finance would become incredibly easy. Sadly, humans don�t work that way.





The system is actively working against millennials, and yet, the notion of �abandoning a dream� isn�t true across the board, because some of us never dreamed of home ownership in the first place.

For myself and some of my friends, owning a house seems more like a burden than an achievement.

 As one recent popular article stated, millennials are �[thinking] differently about what it means to �own� something�. Elsewhere, Fortune has opened a discussion on why we expected millennials to want to own houses at an age when they haven�t settled into their careers or started families yet.



I don't remember when it fully set in. Maybe when I moved

but I remember when the seed was planted



One of the best things I�ve done to change my life � along with meditation, exercise, and eating healthier � is to get rid of most of my clutter.

I downsized, and became a minimalist.

It helped me find space in my life, figure out what was important and focus on that, get rid of visual stress, simplify my life, get unstuck from the trap of consumerism, and get out of debt. Not bad for a simple set of habits!

Now, I know that not everyone wants to be a minimalist, but the ideas of reducing your possessions, downsizing your schedule, and finding space for the important things in your life � I think we can all give this some thought and focus.


Maybe this reflects a simple truth: The more items we own, the less we value them.

Our closets and drawers burst with items we need to organize, clean, maintain, polish, tune, upgrade, store and retrieve. It�s exhausting.

Our closets and drawers burst with items we need to organize, clean, maintain, polish, tune, upgrade, store and retrieve. It�s exhausting.

Our stuff owns us.

But there�s a simple corollary that fixes everything: The less we own, the more we enjoy the few items we have.

Our five favorite shirts. Our tiny, beautiful assortment of plates and bowls. Our mostly-empty pantry that holds only the foods we�re excited to eat.

Owning less isn�t deprivation

We�re not trying to save money. We�re not being frugal for its own sake. We�re asking the deeper question: �Do I want to let this into my life?� Most of the time, that answer is no. And this creates space for the rare things worthy of yes.

Time feels abundant when we�re young, so we squander it with drama and gossip and getting tangled by insecurities. Then we wise up. We own less time now, so we value it more. That�s when we start focusing on regaining control over our time � which is the natural consequence of controlling our money.








Distressingly, 30 to 50 percent of many people's income in the U.S. is now going to pay either their mortgage or for their rent. Clearly, lots of people are house-broke rather than time-rich. Obviously, if you are barely making enough money to pay either, your choices are limited. But if you have a choice, never choose big and more expensive as a tradeoff for your precious time. Then you'll likely never, at the end of your life, look back and think, "Oh I'm so glad I spent so much of my life working to pay for that house."




I already knew that possessions don�t equal happiness. Doesn�t everybody? At least we all profess to know that our things won�t bring us true satisfaction. But in that moment, as I surveyed the pile of stuff in my driveway, another realization came to me: Not only are my possessions not bringing happiness into my life; even worse, they are actually distracting me from the things that do!

I ran inside the house and found my wife upstairs scrubbing a bathtub. Still trying to catch my breath, I said, �Kim, you�ll never guess what just happened. June said we don�t need to own all this stuff!�

And in that moment a minimalist family was born.

I have learned a lot about minimalism in the eight years since my garage-cleaning experience. The best of my discoveries appear in The More of Less. Yet the point I will keep coming back to is the same insight I had on that first day: Our excessive possessions are not making us happy.

Even worse, they are taking us away from the things that do. Once we let go of the things that don�t matter, we are free to pursue all the things that really do matter.




2. Choose people over things.

How much of your day do you spend focused on things? How much of your time is spent earning more money to pay for cars, houses and shopping? Having more stuff seldom makes us happy.

Saying �hello� to a coworker, neighbor, or grocery store clerk, on the other hand, will help you connect with others and spark a moment of humanity and cheer.

2. We see stuff differently.

We attain a new appreciation and respect for the things we do have. We realize what �enough� looks like. Enough means our needs are met. We acquire or keep only those things that are the important and the meaningful in our lives. And we take care of these things. A basement stacked with boxes, overflowing cabinets, piles on the floor, and stuff scattered on every surface is not �enough.� It is excess. It is suffocating. It is preventing us from living our lives.


* Experiences > Possessions: As I have argued in the past, minimalism is not the end of spending. Even when minimalist principles are adopted on a large scale, the transfer of money will still take place�money will just be spent on different things than physical possessions (you can read more here: A New Minimalist Economy). The Millennial generation is proving this to be true, spending less on possessions, but more on wellness, food, drink, and experiences.


Halting the Proliferation of Tools
TNS: But how do you stop the proliferation of tools?

JA:  One of the things that we�ve done for a number of years is to recognize that if you�re going to solve a problem, and you think you need to solve it in a new and novel way that can�t be solved with the technology stack or the patterns that we already have � then that�s fine, it�s just that we need to be explicit about the operational costs of doing so. Introducing something new and different can bear a huge long-term cost to the organization.

TNS:  So it�s not just the case of it being free, it�s also the case of you�ve got to support it, and then other people have to learn bits of it�

JA:  So we do something called �architecture reviews.� I�m a developer; I�m working on this tdumbo_office_063hing; I�ve run into a problem; and I�ve tried the various ways that we typically have tried to solve similar problems; and if those don�t work sufficiently, what I want to do is I want to ask the greater population of engineers at the company, �Hey, I�m working on this problem. I think the only way to solve it is by using this brand-new thing that nobody knows about. Please talk me out of this.�

I want somebody to raise their hand and say �After you�ve described this problem, I know exactly what you�re doing because check this out � six months ago, I had a very similar thing and I finally figured it out. You could just use the thing that I�ve got!�

There�s no reason to re-invent the wheel.

Most of us have more stuff than we need.

I�ve never wanted a normal life; I�ve never thought of having a desk job or a 9-5 type of job. That isn�t the kind of commitment and lifestyle I want. I don�t want to work for the weekends and hate the rest of the five days of the week. Maybe in the future when I feel like slowing down and I find my niche, but not anytime soon.

"If you look at what you have in life, you'll always have more. If you look at what you don't have in life, you'll never have enough." -Oprah Winfrey


We are getting embarrassed over all the wrong things. (tweet that)

Because we live in a culture that normalizes the pursuit of appearances, possessions, and selfish gain, feelings of awkwardness and shame surface when we do not measure up in these areas.

We get embarrassed that our clothes are last year�s fashion, that our vehicle costs less than the neighbor�s, or that our house is smaller than our guest�s. We apologize for the worn carpet, make excuses for the outdated kitchen, or point out specifically why we haven�t updated the countertops yet.

Because those pursuits and values have become normalized, we are prone to feel embarrassment over them�even if there is nothing wrong with the things we already have. This experience (or fear) of embarrassment fuels our urge to own more.

But what would happen if we stopped getting embarrassed over the wrong things and started pursuing the right things?

What if, instead of being embarrassed over the brand of our clothing, we became embarrassed over the size of our walk-in closet?

What if, instead of being embarrassed over the type of car we drive, we became embarrassed over how often we take that luxury for granted?

What if, instead of being embarrassed because our house is too small, we became embarrassed over the amount of unused space within it?

What if, instead of being embarrassed over the quality and quantity of our possessions, we became embarrassed over how much money we have spent on our own selfish pursuits?

What if excess became the embarrassment? And responsible living that championed generosity became the norm?


I am 25, and will be married soon. Anytime I think about buying a home, I ask myself, "What am I supposed to do with it when I move?" That's not "if" I move, but when. My generation wants more freedom to travel, to see and live in new places and to experience new cultures. In general, buying a home can seem like a rejection of freedom, and anytime one of my friends gets a home, I just can't help but think how restricted they now are, whether that's true or not.

At the same time, I can rent a home (especially if I want a yard for dogs or children) and not have to worry about moving. It's a win-win from that angle. As far as earning value on a home, well we all know how that goes these days...

It�s a funny joke, but also an important reminder that life is short and our time with our kids is going to go by fast. With that in mind, I want to make the most of every minute and create the kind of legacy that will endure long after I�m gone. This isn�t a morbid thought, but rather an important way to stay focused on what matters most with every minute we have with our kids.

As parents, we tend to stress about things that don�t matter all that much. Our kids probably aren�t going to remember every detail of our home decor, or how perfect our landscaping looked or whether our refrigerator was stocked was name brands or generics. Let�s focus on what really matters. If you want to know what your kids will remember about you, here it is:

Pretend I want things u don't really want. Sometimes I even convince myself u do want it.

Part of the reason why I don�t like accumulating a lot of valuable stuff is because I�ll then worry more about damage or loss. To worry less, I�ll take out insurance, which requires money that could be used for other things, like great experiences abroad. It�s so much better living on less.

Society has happiness backwards. Instead of always spending more money for bigger, fancier, nicer things to attain happiness, we should be going in REVERSE to see what is the minimum amount of stuff required to be happy.

How many people do you know actively try to minimize what they have? It�s hard to do when we�re in the accumulation phase. But as you hit middle age and beyond, it�s much easier to appreciate the merits of a simpler life. This is why you see many retired folks sell their single family homes to live in service apartments.

Finding more happiness with less is one of the biggest takeaways I�ve garnered from early retirement. I have a feeling that a large number of people are working too long and trying to save too much for some elusive financial goal they think will make them feel secure. We really don�t need that much stuff once we no longer have to work because there are so many amazing activities that don�t require much stuff at all.

Less is so much more!

The more you can live within your means, the easier it is to create financial freedom.

Imagine a life where we could enjoy simple, free pleasures like going for a walk in nature, meditating, reading a book, writing. By buying less we�d have less debt, less clutter, less to take care of. We�d need smaller houses, less storage. Perhaps we could even work less to support all this buying, unless the work were something we loved to do.

Enjoy simple things. There is already enough in front of us, right now, that we don�t need more. We can go for a walk, sit and read a book, do some pushups or yoga, sketch or write or play some music, have a conversation with someone, or do nothing and see what that�s like. We can walk barefoot on grass, drink a cup of tea, create something new, learn about something new, be curious about the life that�s in front of us. This is delightful, without needing to buy more or get more.

But on a vacation, people bond with friends and family, see new places, learn new things and create memories. The same holds true with relatively inexpensive experiences like going out for dinner with friends.

Buy things for their usefulness rather than their status. Stop trying to impress others with your stuff and start trying to impress them with your life.

Remind yourself that possessions do not define you. Abundance of life is not found in the things that you own. Your possessions do not define you or your success�no matter what marketers will try to tell you.

Surely, there must be something more rewarding to do in life.

Saving and time is the key. Conversely if you can�t save, it doesn�t matter if you earn $200k. At the end of your time you will have nothing but a pile of debt, useless possessions you don�t need, an endless need to work hard, and stress.

I have to think carefully and be sensitive to connect with the life of people with �real jobs�. When my friends head off to work every day, it�s a mental shift for me to understand. Yes I understand we need to be fed and housed. However I note a large portion of this work seems to be around paying for things we don�t really need, or making minimum payments on enormous debt. Wage slavery? But hey, my bank shares keep going up, and the dividends keep getting bigger, so who I am to question this system!

a simple life allows you to live more freely...

2. Downsize. Lighten your load in all things tangible, whether that�s your house, your car or the vast array of things you�ve collected over the years. Downsizing feels truly liberating and will offer the added bonus of saving you money. In addition, the fewer the distractions you have, the more you�ll be able to focus on what really matters.

Two close boyhood friends grow up and go their separate ways.  One becomes a humble monk, the other a rich and powerful minister to the king.

Years later they meet.  As they catch up, the minister (in his fine robes) takes pity on the thin, shabby monk.  Seeking to help, he says:

"You know, if you could learn to cater to the king you wouldn�t have to live on rice and beans."

To which the monk replies:

"If you could learn to live on rice and beans you wouldn�t have to cater to the king."

is not *just* about minimizing our material possessions, but about changing our attitudes toward waste and consumerism, and decluttering our mental spaces as well.

You might argue that the stuff would last a lot longer than a set of experiences, and physically it is true. But the happiness you get from stuff fades fast, and then you just take it for granted. The happiness you get from experience never fades.

I was tired of spending hours trying to locate a particular document, sock, shirt, or any other item that had made its way into a black hole. And each moment spent doing so was taking time away from income-generating projects. There's no more sorting through a cluttered closet, garage, bedroom, or any other part of the house for an item I desperately need. We've managed to toss or sell all the extras and neatly organize what remains. Less money spent on replacements and more time available for core business activities. Problem solved.



Speaking of home, it�s weird going from living out of a backpack to having a house full of stuff you�ve amassed. You realize having a house/apartment full of stuff doesn�t make you happy � in fact, all your stuff starts to feel a little overwhelming.

But it gets worse.

Your friends and family and peers � they won�t understand. In fact, they don�t really care that you�ve just gone through this transformative journey. You�ll tell them all about what you ate, saw, and experienced, but I�m telling you that their eyes will quickly gloss over. This will happen just about every time. If you�re lucky, your parents will listen to your tales for a few minutes before wanting to stab finely sharpened #2 pencils into their ears.

It�s lonely knowing that no one else will ever, or can ever, relate to your experiences. But you�ll continue the futile process of trying to tell your story. Be careful because your friends will quickly become sick of your stories.



Give away the things you no longer need; it will help others, and free yourself from distractions

The less stuff you have, the less you have to clean and the less you have to maintain.

Accumulating crap..

2. Owning a lot of stuff actually sucks

No matter how much you love your extensive movie collection, you will hate it when it comes time to move. For me, I travel a lot to begin with. The more �stuff� I have, the more I have to lug around or store. This could be different for someone who settles down and lays roots early, but as a bright-eyed young person, I love the freedom that comes with not owning a house full of stuff. I don�t miss my couch, or my TV, or my extensive movie collection. And when it comes to things like movies, I just download them to my 500GB external hard drive and call it a day. It�s much easier to take everywhere!





, but I soon found myself examining my lifestyle choices. What the hell was I buying? Why did I need these things. How much had I been seduced into the consumer lifestyle? What really makes me happy?

Only unti I turned 30 did I really start slowing down my consumption habits. I was starting to tire from working 60-70 hours a week. I knew my spending habits had to change given I didn�t plan to work forever. Things that once excited my spirit no longer captured my interests. Instead, I started to systematically purge everything I owned that wasn�t a necessity.

What I discovered from donating literally 20 bags worth of stuff to the Salvation Army one year is how liberating it felt to have less! The house is much cleaner now and I no longer have to stuff my drawers tightly due to a lack of space. By driving a $5,000 car instead of an $80,000 car, I no longer worry about anybody denting my doors. By not wearing expensive clothes, I can roll around freely. This 2007 white Macbook I�m using sure has traveled a long way. Things are better now.

Don�t worry about having a nicer car or house or anything material, or even a better-paying job. None of that matters a whit, and none of it will make you happier. You�ll acquire these things and then only want more. Instead, learn to be satisfied with having enough � and then use the time you would have wasted trying to earn money to buy those things � use that time doing things you love.

As we saved, sacrificed, and planned our eventual path out of debt, we found ourselves searching for meaning in everything that we see and do. What we began to realize is that we had been working our lives away to buy stuff. We had been sprinting on a treadmill to nowhere and had been wasting all of the money that we had worked so hard to earn. Even as our incomes grew over the years, we had always been quick to upgrade our lifestyle to match.

When we started to grasp the magnitude of our own financial self-destruction, we became frustrated and angry that we had let our finances get so out of hand. Afterall, what is the point of working anyway? And, what were we truly working for? It was then that we realized that we both wanted so much more out of life than working to buy things. We found out that we wanted experiences. We wanted memories. Most of all we wanted time � time with our children, time to relax, and time to enjoy life itself.

That was a strong enough reason then, and I think that the more privileged should refrain themselves from consuming more than they need. The problem is how you define �need�. But if you are not going to do it for the others, consider the fact that owning little is empowering. Stripping yourself down of the clutter will help you see what matters and is, in my humble opinion, the first step towards finding the meaning in things. It is not an easy thing to find yourself and others when you�ve surrounded yourself with a maze of useless possessions.

I know this exercise isn�t for everyone, but have you considered making an honest inventory or what things you really use, and what things are just� stuff, kept around to sooth improbable anxieties? What essentials would actually you take with you if you had to relocate in a hurry? What things do you use over and over, and what jilted objects do you keep around for no other reason than having dust accumulate on them?

If we are to focus on becoming wealthy, then I argue that a path to wealth is pretty straight forward. Provide more value to someone than you cost and you�ll achieve enough riches to lead a content life. Get into work before everybody else and leave after everyone else and surely you will get ahead in your career. Consistently save and invest and surely you�ll amass a nice little fortune.

It�s the definition of rich which is the biggest variable. Some think owning five cars, five houses, and alligator shoes is the definition of rich. Meanwhile others are happy with just a backpack of necessities to their name and the ability to travel wherever they want, whenever they want.


One of the beauties on downsizing your home is the ability to stop wasting money on furniture, electronics, appliances, and home items that are used to fill space rather than to fulfill a function. Downsizing into a smaller home will you help you prioritize your life and only bring what is necessary in your home.

Many homeowners agree that living in a larger home leads to greater stress and upkeep. From cleaning, maintenance, furnishing, outdoor home upkeep and the cost to run all of these factors can lead to a home that is stressful. Downsizing your home can be the first step to a minimal and stream-lined life. You will be surprised how reducing your daily chores and maintenance will free up your time for leisure activities, spending time with your family, getting more rest, and maybe loving your home more than loathing it.

What is that stuff doing for you? It�s rusting, falling apart, cracking, drying out or otherwise deteriorating. It�s an asset, but it�s declining in value instead of earning you more money and funding your retirement.

You need to store that stuff, don�t you? Is it taking up too much space, forcing you rent storage? Do you feel the clutter, closing you in, shortening your breath?

If you want to shorten your commute or take a better job somewhere else, you have to take all that with you don�t you? Do you feel the harness around your body, tying you to your purchases of days gone by, slowing you down, holding you back?

Stuff holds you down. You should be able to feel that now.


And here�s the sad truth about my collectibles: It really made no difference to me. Whereas these comics had once been a core piece of my identity, they�d become a burden. I�d lugged them from the Canby house to the Oak Grove house to the apartment in northeast Portland to my new condo in Sellwood. I was done. I felt no need to possess them. I wanted money instead.

8.  All that stuff for sale you don�t need.
Too many people buy things they don�t need with money they don�t have to impress people they don�t know.  Don�t be one of them.  Stop buying stuff on impulse!  Avoid the mall!  The mall is not a source of entertainment.  It�s a source of personal debt.  There�s no reason to tease yourself by staring at a bunch of brand new junk you don�t need.  And as you know, the novelty of a new purchase wears thin long before the credit card bill arrives.

So as I�ve said before, live a comfortable life, not a wasteful one.  Do not spend to entertain yourself or impress others.  Do not fool yourself into thinking wealth is measured in material objects.  Manage your money wisely so your money does not manage you.  (Read The Total Money Makeover.)
live a simple life, intentional

who defines success as being wealthy

Certainly, there is a direct link with the number of possessions we own and the stress we experience. Every increased possession adds increased anxiety unto our lives. There is a direct relationship also with excess possessions and an overall lack of time, energy, and focus. Your biggest investment also represents your greatest opportunity.

Consider the benefits of living in a smaller home: less expense, less worry, less upkeep�more time, more money, more freedom, and more opportunity.


You can have anything you want  but you can�t have everything you want. Being smart with money isn�t about giving up your plasma TV or your daily latte. It�s about setting priorities and managing expectations, about choosing to spend only on the things that matter to you, while cutting costs on the things that don�t.

Gilovich's prior work has shown that experiences tend to make people happier because they are less likely to measure the value of their experiences by comparing them to those of others. For example, Gilbert and company note in their new paper, many people are unsure if they would rather have a high salary that is lower than that of their peers, or a lower salary that is higher than that of their peers. With an experiential good like vacation, that dilemma doesn't hold. Would you rather have two weeks of vacation when your peers only get one? Or four weeks when your peers get eight? People choose four weeks with little hesitation.

9.  What you own is not who YOU are.

Stuff really is just stuff, and it has absolutely no bearing on who you are as a person.  Most of us can make do with much less than we think we need.  That�s a valuable reminder, especially in a hugely consumer-driven culture that focuses more on material things than meaningful connections and experiences.



�this generation not only highly values experiences, but they are increasingly spending time and money on them: from concerts and social events to athletic pursuits, to cultural experiences and events of all kinds. For this group, happiness isn�t as focused on possessions or career status. Living a meaningful, happy life is about creating, sharing and capturing memories earned through experiences that span the spectrum of life�s opportunities.;w
o
 To �own something� in the traditional sense is becoming less important, because what�s scarce has changed. Ownership just isn�t hard anymore. We can now find and own practically anything we want, at any time, through the unending flea market of the Internet. Because of this, the balance between supply and demand has been altered, and the value has moved elsewhere.


#10: Don�t Buy Stuff.

We (especially those of us in the developed/industrialized world) all have too much stuff. And the sad fact is that most of it goes unused, and most of it isn�t actually worth anything as soon as we buy it.

In fact, owning too much stuff causes decision fatigue � we have to work out when/how/if we will use it.

I discovered this recently as I am preparing to go traveling for a year; cutting down my accumulated stuff has been nothing short of eye-opening.

The fewer belongings we have, the less stress we have (about them) and the fewer worries we have (about them) as well. Plus, not buying stuff is good for your wallet and makes decisions simple: you can focus on the important things, not on accumulating more stuff. And this makes you more productive.


One Ikea boss dubbed it �peak curtains� � the realisation that we can no longer carry on buying stuff at the same rate and in the same volume that we did before, and recently there has been a trend for decluttering, thanks to professional organiser Marie Kondo. It may all be a reaction to a world that tells us more is better, where we�re dazzled into buying the newest and shiniest item on the shelves. It�s a system that encourages us to drag ourselves into work for eight hours a day in order to earn money to buy more things, and then tells us the stuff we bought isn�t shiny enough and we need an upgrade. So it�s back to work we go.

Maybe we�re beginning to realise that constant consumption is like running on a treadmill
