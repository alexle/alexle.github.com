This week’s article is as much a reminder to myself as it is advice for you. I haven’t done a good job of managing my time, lately. Instead of writing or pushing my side projects forward, I’ve been binge-watching Netflix, reading blog posts full of productivity tips, and playing copious amounts of Pokémon Go.

Time to re-focus.

Here are some tips for making more time for your side projects. I’ll be re-implementing a bunch of them myself, this week.


The time before you go to bed is golden, as it exists every single day, and itís usually completely yours to schedule. What do you want to do with this time? Read? Spend time with your kids? Work on a hobby youíre passionate about? Take advantage of this time.

That time between clocking out of work and hitting the sheets every night is yours to do whatever you want. Using that time to pursue something meaningful to you will immensely improve not only your total well being, but sense of self worth. But the reality is that, after a long dayís work, you feel exhausted and all you want to do is to take a long break and zone out with the television on.

Netflix may not be a great idea, but documentaries and TED talks can lead to a greater understanding in a multitude of disciplines. Itís all in how you prioritize your life after work.

Starting and consistently doing or creating something will give you a sense of empowerment that can translate in the office as well. Extracurricular outlets donít just boost your sanity?ó?they feed back into your day job and can actually make you more productive.

But the daily grind can easily overshadow your passion project like writing a book, learning a new language, starting an online business, creating art, learning an instrument, designing, learning to code, collecting and selling vintage objects etc. Itís not enough to show up to work on time, and do a good job. You have to remain relevant and consistently improve to become a better version of yourself.




he 60/30 minutes rule

For the next 30 days, devote just 60 minutes of your time after work to the best opportunity in your life. Nothing else. Zero distractions. Your single most important task within that time is to make even the smallest progress on your passion project. You donít have to make significant progress. But it matters that you stay consistent. Spend an hour a day to learn about a topic

Exercise your creative genius. Anything new to your brain can stimulate it. Different skills, ideas, cultures, and opinions can have a positive effect on your own views about the world.

Acquiring new skills and gaining knowledge on a daily incremental basis is a proven way to take your career to the next level and improve your self-esteem. When was the last time you questioned the existing convention, conceptualized problems differently, approached problems in new, innovative way. Itís about time you figured out what could be improved, challenged, done different, done with less effort to achieve more. Start questioning everything. Consider everything. Go through every possibility until you know for a fact it can or cannot be done. Re-think your evening routine!

If you make creative pursuit part of your weekly schedule, at least Monday through Friday, youíll begin to see change as long as you keep doing it at the same time each day. Make it a habit to see significant improvement. A routine at night means better time management.

Think of all of the time that was either used productively or possibly wasted after work till the time you go to sleep and ask yourself what could I have done or can I do with all of that time?

There truly are no limits as to what you could have learned or


Writing allows you to become better at formulating ideas over time, and to communicate with more prowess.

Most importantly, it will help you work out what reverberates with you and others, which you can speak about more confidently anywhere.

Iøve found personally that I love writing about making an impact with our creative skills. Some people, Iøve found, even enjoy reading it! But my voice and my passion on this has grown through writing lots, based on personal experience.

The cool thing is you can read over what you write and order your words so that people think youøre really clever.

Iøm pretty sucky at speaking my words. Iøm much better at sharing ideas through written words.

Many shy artists are daunted by the idea of appearing in front of a camera. People rave about the importance of producing videos and podcasting for marketing. They are effective, but writing has its place, and it can lead to video and audio if you choose to go there.

The written word, in my view, will continue to be the most enduring form of media many decades into the future, leaving a legacy for those that contribute words that arenøt only about what they had for brunch.




I would have days where Iíd become very depressed because, after all that, I hadnít created anything. Nothing had come of it and it had no tangible benefit. I realised I was consuming merely to pass the time, and using it as a way to escape from real work.

Now, Iím trying my best to create something every day, blog as often as I can and generally be a source rather than a destination for the information on the internet. I still value consumption extremely highly ó thereís nothing I enjoy more than learning something new ó but I need to be a creator, not a consumer.

Live a comfortable life, not a wasteful one.  Stop buying stuff you do not need.  Do not spend to impress others.  Do not live life trying to fool yourself into thinking wealth is measured in material objects.  Manage your money wisely so your money does not manage you.

Do it F***ing Now.
Don’t wait. Don’t procrastinate. The winners in this world are not the ones who find the greatest excuses to put off doing what they know will make them more money. The winners are the ones that prioritize and seize the day.

Create a list of action items to make sure your important tasks get accomplished. Every project you’re working on should be in action. If you’re not moving, you’re standing still. Your next step towards making money must not be “something I’ll take care of maybe sometime next week.” If it’s going to help make you money: Do it F***ing Now.

Some of you may think that you don’t need the “f***ing” in “do it f***ing now”. You do. You need that impact, that force, that call to action, that kick in the ass to get you moving. Otherwise, you’ll end up another loser that had a great idea a long time ago but never did anything about it. Dreamers don’t make money. Doers make money. And doers “Do it F***ing Now.”

We all have a finite number of hours in a day ñ 24 to be exact.  What we choose to do with those hours is of the utmost importance. We can waste our time, or we can use our time to improve ourselves and our lives. I
