Does Having The Best Phone Matter Anymore?


I used to be a big sucker for new electronics. I liked to own the latest and greatest, and got excited to watch new product announcements. This time of year is especially trying, as the new iPhone and Google phones are announced. New features, new design, all the glitter!

Following the launch of a new smartphone, you’ll quickly hear the hoop-da-la about the latest and greatest features. It has a better screen! It can charge wirelessly! It’s in super high definition! But everybody fails to mention that most of the features that are packed into these new devices are also found in the previous versions.

The Marginal Utility of New
The marginal utility of a new device, or the useful gains in getting the new version of a product, are usually fairly small. From a daily use stand point, almost everything a new phone does, the previous version does as well. The marginal increase in utility is not significant. The main difference, is the cost.



When you break down how you use a piece of technology like a smartphone, you’ll quickly find that you likely have set number of use cases. Calling, texting, and using a handful of apps is typical for most people. The requirements for doing those tasks is often basic, and found on most phones that were made in the past 2-4 years.  The impact of new features for most products is more about marketing, than it is about bettering your life. 

When to Upgrade Your Gadgets
Don’t get me wrong – I’m not advocating that you live like a hermit in the stone age. There are real benefits to using new technologies. Our quality of life is improved when we communicate with friends, share memories, and have access to productive tools. So there is a time and place for upgrading your gadgets.

The concept of marginal utility is based on the margin, or the changes on the very edge of product development. Meaning, the changes in brand new products, over the most recent previous version. This is the place where you tend to have the least increase in benefits, at the highest level of cost.

However, if you look further down the product line, jumping from 3-4 versions back, to a newer version, you can begin to have more significant increases in utility. At this level, you are no longer working on marginal changes, but compounded improvements overtime.

The time cycle of when changes become significant is dependent on a few factors:

The Innovation Speed of the Product
Your Personal Use Cases
Your Budget to Purchase Items
Products like smartphones tend to have notable changes on a 2-4 year horizon. Whereas automobiles tend to have more of a 7-10 year significant change cycle. Examining how you use your products, as well as doing research can help you determine when you are going to upgrade.

As we mentioned above, a lot of the improvements to this year’s flagships are cosmetic—in terms of the software on board, and the apps you can run, they’re almost identical to mid-range handsets and the flagships of yesteryear. iOS 11, for example, will run on anything from the iPhone 5S onwards, the Instagram app for iOS will run on any device that can handle iOS 9.0, and so on.

Over on the Google side of the fence, Android has a well-publicized problem with fragmentation, but considering that all of Google’s apps update separately from the OS, it’s not as a big a deal as you might imagine. Android itself is now basically a bunch of underlying protocols and settings—the headline new feature in Android 8.0 Oreo is being able to snooze notifications—so those of you on 6.0 and 7.0 aren’t missing out too much.

To be clear, it’s better to be on the most recent OS updates, and your apps are going to be snappier on newer hardware, but the point is that these differences are becoming smaller and smaller with each round of flagship launches.

Maybe you’re still going to splurge on the iPhone X and really make the most of that new wireless charging feature Apple introduced this year. Or maybe you’re already in love with your Samsung Galaxy S8 and watch a ton of Netflix on its lovely display. For the majority of us, though, the flagship appeal just isn’t what it used to be.
