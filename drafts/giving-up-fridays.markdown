When I started on this whole self-improvement journey, I thought I had to sacrifice things.

“I can’t go out every weekend anymore.”
“I can’t spend my money on useless things.”
“I can’t go on a holiday this year.”
“I need to read every day.”
“I need to stay positive.”
When you put it like that to yourself, it looks like you’re sacrificing many things in your life. But that’s the wrong way to look at it.

When you think you have to sacrifice something in your life in order to be successful, what do you think will happen?

You will build frustration and resentment towards yourself. And guess what happens then? That lofty goal that should have made you happy ends up making you miserable.

Don’t Sacrifice—Prioritize
I live by a simple rule: If I think something is a sacrifice, I’m not going to do it.

I look at everything I do as a choice. No one forced me to work hard. Similarly:

You’re not sacrificing your free time. You’re spending your time to get better at what you do.
You’re not sacrificing fun. You’re getting smarter by reading a book.
You’re not sacrificing a holiday and rest. You’re loving the grind.
Sure, everyone needs time off. In fact, I believe rest increases our productivity. I’m not talking about that here. It’s about the way we look at our lives.

If you change your mindset from” I’m sacrificing something” to “I’m choosing something,” you’re prioritizing your life. You are no longer looking at what you’re missing out on; instead, you look at what you’re getting out of your life.

You know, this idea of sacrificing things to become successful comes from our nature to compare our lives to others. Why do you think you look at things as a sacrifice? Compared to what? Exactly, you compare it to what others do.

“Well, so and so is having an avocado salad at a rooftop bar in SoHo.” Who gives a shit.




I’m running my second New York Marathon. I can’t recommend fall marathons enough. They’re the most inspiring, challenging, and exhilarating opportunity to wreck your entire summer. You will cross the finish line with a sense of accomplishment like you’ve never imagined. You will wear your medal and your weird foil cape thing with pride. You will have memories, stories to last a lifetime, and race pictures where you look like you’re undergoing enhanced interrogation.

You will also, about 15 times in a row, drop an atomic bomb on your weekend in the form of the Long Run.

[Run faster, stronger, and longer with this 360-degree training program.]

Each Saturday or Sunday starting in the late spring—just when things are warming up, just when an outdoor table at your favorite brunch spot calls your name—you wake up earlier than you would for work, put on your running shoes, and head out. Once a week, your objective is to run as far as you can, and then run a couple miles more. An hour or four of nonstop pavement-pounding. One big assignment that sits smugly on your calendar and stares you down all week long.

It stinks, and I love it. Never more so than when it absolutely ruined a perfectly good day of a trip to London.


Giving up Friday night for Saturday mornings (self.running)
submitted 16 hours ago by CarouselCourt
I was training for my first marathon over the summer that I didn't end up running (injury...feet - can't run with them, can't run without them) that had me doing long saturday runs as most training programs do. Because it was over the summer, I often had to wake up early before it got incredibly hot in order to get a meaningful run in.
I'm able to run again, and I've kept up this practice of running early Saturday mornings, even though I live in Chicago and it is freezing cold at 5:30 AM. This is my absolute favorite time to run - I stay in on Friday nights (tough opportunity to give up being a 23 yo single guy in the city) and run errands - dry cleaning, haircut, grocery store. I set my alarm/coffee maker for 45 mins before the sunrise, lay out my clothes and shoes and hit the road the next morning.
A lot of my friends think I'm crazy for not going out on Friday's, but it's all worth it, because by the time I get to the Lake, this is my view:

Just thought I'd share, feel free to share your favorite times to run..


I'm with ya. And like /u/sholder89/ says, long runs on Saturday make Saturday night the best. Nothing like getting the long run out of the way, having brunch with friends, taking a shower and glorious nap, and still having the rest of the afternoon and evening to do whatever you like.


Saying I can't stay out late because I'm running early the next morning helps feed my JOMO (Joy Of Missing Out).


I have adopted the same pattern! I don't miss staying up late on Fridays. And if there's some social decent I really care about, I can always move the long run to Sunday for a week. :)


It's a balance thing. I think it's important to reconcile different areas of your life in order to keep the house in order, so to speak. Sometimes that means less partying, drinking, and socializing, but in the end, as long as it's not all the time, it's worth it. But having goals and making sacrifices to achieve them is important sometimes as well. During my peak training I'm pretty notoriously unavailable when it comes to hanging out. If it's an emergency I'm there, otherwise I need to make those plans ahead of time so I can see about scheduling my running in such a way as to preserve my social life.


I do this too man, 28 and married though. I'll give up a noisy bar for a night in and a morning run. Heading out for the sunrise over the Rockies is a good morning in my book.

26 yo single male here just completed my second marathon and do the same as you, I find Saturday nights are more fun anyway especially when you have something to celebrate like running a fucking 20 miler that morning before most people were awake! Keep on keeping on my man it's all worth it!



But millennials—if you believe the Post, and why wouldn't you?—are skipping past all that bullshit, those late-20s nights where you don't even enjoy waking up in a field but feel obligated to by your fear that you will be washed up if you don't spend Saturday puking while texting your friends to remind you not to mix mead and herbs, then going to brunch. Fuck going out. Fuck "out." It's expensive, it's crowded, it smells bad, the bands are usually terrible, the clubs are usually worse.

You know what's great? Sitting around and watching TV. Have you tried it? You get to wear comfortable clothes, summon whatever food you want via phone and eat it with your hands, go to bed when you choose—for most of the humans who have ever lived, this generation's typical night in represents an impossible pinnacle of luxury. People used to worry about stuff like drought, famine, and a new band of men with swords riding into town. Don't underestimate the simple luxuries of a glass of wine, a roof overhead, and a screen that can show you anything you can imagine.

So stay in tonight. Get a decent bottle of red wine or one of those bourgeois-ass beers that's brewed with like, lemon peels. Watch an entire Prince concert or a shitload of Peep Show. Or, fuck it, go Full Old and read a book. Sleep when you're tired. Wake up feeling rested for once. Go to the park. You'd be surprised by all the places you can go when you're not going out, and how nice the people are once you're there.
