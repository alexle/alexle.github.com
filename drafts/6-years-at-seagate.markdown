Qualtrics: “There are 2 types of decisions: 1-way door decisions and 2-way door decisions. Be involved with the former, but less and less in the latter.” 1-way door decisions cannot be reversed, and if a mistake is made there, you’ll have to live with it for a long while, whereas with 2-way door decisions you can always go back and change path. This follows Jeff Bezos’s warning on type 1 and type 2 decisions, and how being unable to treat them differently eventually leads to bad organizations. Examples of 1-way doors: raising money; modifying the compensation plan, buying a company, rewriting a product.


It’s better to have a hole in your org. than an asshole.“ It’s a great catchphrase of hers and is important to keep in mind: we tend to overestimate the negative impact of letting go someone and ignore the damage done by leaving things as they are. Yes, letting go of someone might shake up the team for a moment, but a couple of weeks later your company will be in a better place, and everyone should see the value of the decision by then.



Every company wants to hold onto their best talent for as long as possible, yet top performing employees are often one of the first to quit. This is costly and disruptive to the organization and affects the people on their teams as well. If you want your best employees to stay, take a closer look at the following six factors that impact their decision to quit.

They’re overworked.

Being overworked is the top reason employees quit, especially top performers. When you have a high performing employee, it’s easy to fall into the pattern of giving them extra work. There’s a fine line to walk here - you have to find the balance between extra work and overworked. There’s a difference between giving an employee more work because they’re the best person to handle it and continuously piling on extra tasks. Nothing is more frustrating to a top performer than consistently being given extra work because their colleagues weren’t able to complete it.

If you’re consistently relying on your top performing employees to do more and have greater responsibilities, then you should consider giving them some sort of promotion. Ideally this will include a raise, but if that isn’t possible, a new job title that highlights their increased responsibility and puts them on a path to a raise in the near future is also sufficient. If you simply increase their workload without changing anything, they’ll find another employer who will better meet their needs.

They’re not being challenged.

Top performers become disengaged when they aren’t being challenged at work. They thrive on working towards goals and being pushed outside of their comfort zones. Set stretch goals for them to achieve and they’ll work hard to meet them. Give them nothing but tasks that are easy to accomplish, and they’ll quickly get bored. Create stimulating work and your top performers will thrive.

Be careful that you aren’t simply piling on extra work, as that’s not challenging, but rather annoying to the employee. The challenge should be something that stimulates them either intellectually or creatively. Have top performers work on a project that isn’t going well and let them figure out ways to improve it. Create opportunities for them to exercise their brainpower and utilize their skills.

They’re being stifled.

Top performers are passionate about the work that they do. They’ll eagerly take the lead on a project or head up a new initiative. They want to be able to pursue opportunities and explore new ideas at work. Too often this passion is stifled and they’re told to put their ideas aside and focus simply on the tasks they’re given. This is detrimental in a myriad of ways, most notably to employee engagement. This hits two-fold as well - if they’re being stifled they’re also likely not being challenged.

Don’t force your top performers to work a certain way unless it’s absolutely required that they follow a specific process. This frustrates them, as they know that they can both accomplish the task at hand as well as focus on their ideas without any decrease in their performance. If the outcome is successful it shouldn’t matter how they’ve gotten their results. Allow them to explore different approaches to doing things and exercise their creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving skills.

They aren’t given developmental opportunities.

For high performers development isn’t just about learning new skills, it’s about opportunities to expand their skillsets and translate those skills into new opportunities. Skill development can get overlooked for top performers because they’re already talented. Just because they’re able to do things incredibly well doesn’t mean they aren’t looking for opportunities to learn and grow.

Provide them with rich developmental opportunities such as shadowing someone in a senior role, taking courses to learn a new technical skill, or pairing them up with a mentor. These developmental opportunities show that you’re invested in their future. It also helps them build skills that can put them one step closer to a promotion or other job advancement.

They aren’t appreciated.

Nothing turns an employee off more than feeling like their work isn’t being recognized. For top performers, this is even more important as they are often taking on more high-stakes work. If they are consistently performing above average yet getting no recognition, two things will happen. One, they’ll stop putting nearly as much effort into their work, and two, they’ll start searching for another job.

Appreciation can be as simple as telling an employee that they’ve done a good job. That proverbial pat on the back goes a long way to keeping them motivated. Go one step further and find out what motivates each employee personally. For some people, that’s public recognition, for others, it’s private. Tailoring the way you show appreciation makes it that much more sincere, and will be that much more appreciated.

They aren’t compensated fairly.

Your best employees are highly talented, driven, and motivated individuals, and they know it. If they aren’t being compensated fairly, they’ll be looking for a new job faster than you can ask why. Top performers know their value and use that to their advantage when job searching. This also prompts them to start looking for new work faster than other employees, as they feel more confident in their ability to get another job.

Compensation isn’t just about money. A lot of times the company’s budget truly doesn’t allow for a significant increase in salary, so it’s important to think about other factors that add value to the employee. This can be a title change that comes with increased responsibility, access to senior leadership for mentoring, or rewards like bonus vacation days or a flexible schedule.

What it really comes down to is that you can’t take your top talent, or any employees, for granted. If you want people to stay at your company, you need to make sure that you’re meeting their needs and giving them a reason not to leave.






Creative subtraction.

Simplifying is a creative process. Picture an artist with a lump of raw marble, carving away to create something beautiful. Picture a writer, starting off with a shitty first draft and editing it until narrative forms. Picture a chef, reducing a complex recipe down to a few, curated ingredients. Instead of adding, they subtract. We can do this in all areas of our lives.

Sometimes the answer is less, not more. Bruce Lee was an advocate of this, saying ‘it is not the daily increase but the daily decrease. Hack away at the inessential.’ Since discovering minimalism last year, I have been pruning my life. When I want to make a change in my life, I was what I can subtract. A dependency, a commitment, a time suck. Within reason, the more I remove, the better my life is. This is not a process of destruction, it is one of creation.




Reasons engineers are unproductive may include:

burnout
boredom
lack of focus
lack of prioritization
insufficient knowledge
tech debt
external blockers






2. Don't repeat yourself
As Agile Manifesto co-author Robert C. Martin said, "Duplication is the primary enemy of a well-designed system." Few other bad coding practices will destroy your code faster than duplication. Avoiding duplication must be one of your primary concerns as you are writing test automation code. You must attack duplication from all levels.

Duplication can be simply a few lines of code that consistently repeat. 

3. Keep functions small

"The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that."  

øRobert C. Martin


Although this seems like a weird rule to have for improving test automation code, it's a rule that is truly powerful. When you create small functions, several things are achieved. First, the functions will be easier to name. Second, the functions will be easier to understand. Third, the functions will more closely adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle.

4. Write code only for the current requirements
This rule is a way to tell you to stop over-engineering. Over-engineering usually occurs as a result of a developer attempting to protect his or her code from future changes that may or may not occur.

There are many different ways to over-engineer your test code. One example is trying to create code that can handle all future scenarios. I've seen test automation engineers try to automate an entire page object before they even need all of the elements. They will create a class that represents an HTML page. However, rather than simply adding properties and methods that they require for the current test, they will add all actions and locators to their class.

This is a horrible mistake because they can't be sure if they will ever use that code. Nobody can be sure. So the end result is that they create giant classes that have very little usable code. Anyone interacting with that code must navigate through useful and useless methods and properties. This is a pointless exercise that simply wastes time.

The best way to prevent yourself from writing complicated code is to simply follow the current requirements. If you need to test whether a method is returning the appropriate string, then simply write a test for that. Do not try to test for future conditions that are not yet tangible. Certainly, do not add any extra code to the system to satisfy these useless tests.
Big improvements
It's true that writing test code can be hard. However, remember to treat your test code just like your production code. First, validate that your tests will actually fail when they are supposed to. Second, follow the "don't repeat yourself' principle so that maintenance can be easy when the inevitable time arrives. Third, keep your functions tiny. Finally, code your tests to meet only the current requirements.

With these four rules, applied at regular intervals, you will notice a dramatic improvement in the readability, stability, and maintainability of your test automation code.




It’s no secret that the demands of the workplace are changing at an increasingly rapid pace. In fact, an Oxford University study found that the “half-life” of job skills has decreased from 30 years in 1984 to just five years in 2014, and the trend has only continued since. This is evidence that the most successful employees in the future won’t be the ones who’ve spent years honing a single skill. Instead, organizations will value the employees who are eager for constant learning throughout their careers.

Upskilling used to be mainly a company-driven effort, but today’s employees need to pick up the torch and take the initiative to improve their ability to deliver value to the organization. As technology contributes to rapid changes in the job market, learning new skills helps workers remain relevant and valued, and it prepares them for a future in which their current roles might even cease to exist.

In addition to future-proofing your worth at work, upskilling can help you discover new talents and passions that you never knew you had. Maybe you learn to code and discover that you enjoy making websites or developing applications, or perhaps you take a personal finance class and develop a mastery of spreadsheets that skyrockets your productivity at work. Not all upskilling opportunities have to seem relevant to your job at first; once you start learning, you’ll be surprised what you can take back to work.




Email is (usually) a very small percentage of work responsibility and consumes a disproportionate amount of our time and energy – if you were to ask yourself, “What is the thing I do that provides the most value to my organization?” it’s probably not email. But how time do you actually get to spend doing that? Remember, if you’re the average US worker, you’re spending 6.3 hours dealing with email. If you actually saw the time reports side-by-side, you probably wouldn’t like it very much.


Touch it once

Have you ever had to reread the same email two, three or four times? Maybe you get a notification on your phone so you look to see what it is. You see that it’s important, but you can’t do anything with it right now so you leave it in your inbox and put your phone back in your pocket. Then when you get back to the office, you see it again but your boss just asked you for something urgent so, again, you just leave it in your inbox. You might look at that email 10 times before you actually respond!

What is the 2-Minute Rule?

If you’ve read the book Getting Things Done (or any material on GTD), you’ve probably heard of this rule before. It’s simple: whenever you have to do something, if it takes less than 2 minutes to do, you should do it right away. If it takes longer than 2 minutes, then you should put it on your todo list (or into your task manager) and move on to the next thing.

This concept is especially important when it comes to dealing with email. If you can process an email in less than 2 minutes, it’s generally better to do it right away. Otherwise, you should put it in your task manager to deal with later. But no matter what action you take, the next step is to get it out of your inbox so you don’t have to make this decision about what to do with it more than once.

This is really important. When you combine the Touch-It-Once principle with the 2 Minute Rule (2MR), you have the 80/20 of handling emails efficiently.






CLEAN CODER:


1. Do No Harm
Software is too complex to create without bugs.

However, you must be accountable for errors even though errors are virtually certain. Apologies are necessary, but insufficient. You cannot simply keep making the same errors over and over. As you mature in your profession, your error rate should rapidly decrease towards zero. It is your responsibility to get as close as possible to it.


2. QA should find nothing.

Some folks use QA as the bug catchers. They send them code that they haven't thoroughly checked. This behaviour is just plain lazy and irresponsible. Releasing code that you don't know works is unprofessional.

3. You must know it works.

Test it. Test it again.

Every time QA finds something the development team should react in horror. They should ask themselves how it happened and take steps to prevent it in the future.

4. Work Ethic
It is not your employer's responsibility to make sure you are marketable. It is not your employer's responsibility to train you, or to send you to conferences, or to buy you books. These things are your responsibility.

You should plan on working 60 hours a week. The first 40 are for your employer. The remaining 20 are for you. During this remaining 20 hours you should be reading,

5. Good Code
First, your code must work. You must understand what problem you are solving and understand how to solve that problem. You must ensure that the code you write is a faithful representation of that solution. You must manage every detail of that solution while remaining consistent within the language, platform, current architecture, and all the warts of the current system.

Your code must solve the problem set for you by the customer. Often the customer's requirements do not actually solve the customer's problems. It is up to you to see this and ensure that the customer's true needs are met.

Your code must fit well into the existing system. It should not increase the rigidity, fragility, or opacity of that system. In short, your code needs to follow solid engineering principles.

Your code must be readable by other programmers. It requires you to craft the code in such a way that it reveals your intent. This may be the most difficult thing a programmer can master.


6. 3 AM Code
When you cannot concentrate and focus sufficiently, the code you write will be wrong. It will have bugs. It will have have the wrong structure. It will be opaque and convoluted. It will not solve the customers' real problems. In short, it will have to be reworked or redone. Working while distracted creates waste.

7. False Delivery
The worst thing to do as a programmer is saying you are done when you know you aren't.

8. 



Setting up our classes to enforce this can be tricky. It helps to draw a distinction between traditional OOP objects and data structures. Data structures should expose data and contain no behavior. OOP objects should expose behavior and limit access to data. In languages like C, these are separate entities, and you have to explicitly choose one of these types.





Still, even when it seems you’re doing everything right — you’re never late to work, rarely take a sick day, and always meet deadlines —promotions can be few and far between.

You’re putting the work in, so why aren’t you getting rewarded? The answer is simple: you don’t get promoted for fulfilling your boss’s expectations.

Your boss’s expectations are the price of entry. Even if you’re making a great effort and doing all that’s asked of you, you won’t stand out. You’ll be seen as someone who completes the minimum requirements, and no one who builds a great career is seen this way.

The trick to advancing your career and getting paid more is to add value by making certain your contributions are worth more than you’re paid. You want to go above and beyond so that you’re seen as someone highly valuable — someone the organization can’t live without.

You should aim to exceed your boss’s expectations so much that he feels like he’s the smartest guy in the world for hiring you.

This isn’t as hard as it sounds. In fact, you can blow your boss’s mind in seven easy steps.

1. Professional development is important, but why stop there? If you really want to blow your boss’s mind, soak up everything you can about your company and your industry. For example, if you’re an IT developer, instead of simply learning the current best practices in coding, learn how those practices are being applied throughout your industry.

Transferring your knowledge to the real-world context of your organization is a great way to add value. On top of knowing how to do your job, it shows that you know why you’re doing it and why it matters.

2. Anticipate what she wants to stay on top of, and send her regular updates. You’ll save her time and energy, and she’ll appreciate that just as much as your enthusiasm.

3. Instead of owning up to mistakes once they’re discovered, bring them to light yourself

Accountability is a lost art. Too many people try to cover up their mistakes, fearing the repercussions of admitting fault. Show your boss that you’re not afraid to own up to your mistakes, and he’ll be amazed. When you make a mistake, just give your boss a simple heads-up, and have a solution ready. Even better, tell him the steps you’ve already taken to mitigate the problem.

Everyone makes mistakes. You’ll stand out by showing your boss that you’re accountable, creative, and proactive when you inevitably make them.


5. Instead of doing what you’re told, be proactive

Anybody (well, almost anybody) can do what they’re told. To blow your boss’s mind, you have to be proactive. If you see a problem, fix it. If you see something that needs doing, do it. Put together a how-to guide for new hires, document your processes and figure out where you can streamline them, or do whatever else you can think of to make a difference.

Bosses appreciate vision more than anything. They love it when you see what could be useful to the company over the long term—and don’t forget to tell your boss about it. It’s only “kissing up” if you do it manipulatively or with the intention of making your co-workers look bad. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with owning your accomplishments.








Many managers say flat-out that their biggest frustration is when employees are not prepared for a one-on-one meeting. 1. Share whatøs been most motivating to you.
Managers crave to know what they should be doing to help you do your best work. After all, a managerøs ultimate job is to create an environment that enables you to tap into your own intrinsic motivation. During your one-on-one, make sure you share what tangibly has been most motivating to you while at the company: Whatøs been your favorite project? Who was someone you really enjoyed working it? Why was what you were working on so invigorating to you? 2. Reveal whatøs been draining and demotivating to you.
As an employee, itøs always tough to bring up a critique of the companyø especially if itøs about your own managerøs habits and actions. Youøre worried itøll be misinterpreted as øcomplain-y,ø that your manager will take it personally, and that it could affect your career progression. Or perhaps worst, youøll put in all the effort of sharing your feedback and nothing will happen. While all of those scenarios might be possible outcomes, what we must remember is that if we donøt talk about it, our managers will never know about it. The little thingsøøøwhether itøs your manager interrupting you during meetings or always asking you to stay lateøøøadd up. They gnaw away at your ability to feel energized about your work. If you donøt say something, then who will? When you do speak up and vocalize tough feedback, look to approach the conversation with care, observation, fallibility, and curiosity. Itøs a hard, delicate path to travel. But itøs a worthwhile path if you want your work environment to become better. 3. Explain how you want to stretch and grow.
Your one-on-one with your manager is your chance to let her know how youød like to be further pushed and challenged in your role (or outside your role). Take time to reflect on what youød like to improve or work on professionally. Perhaps itøs something more broad, like learning to be more patient and strategic in your thinking. Or maybe itøs much more about gaining a specific skill, such as becoming a better writer. Suggest potential projects for how youød like to grow in those areas, and see if your manager has any ideas around it. Ask your manager for advice on what books, classes, or people you should be talking to help you pursue the greater learning youøre looking for.





The reality of being a programmer is a bit less sexy than our Hollywood counterparts however. Our bosses and co-workers donøt give a damn about how elegant our code is. They donøt understand that we are asked every single day to estimate how long it will take to code features and fixes that we have absolutely no idea about until that very moment. Frankly, weøre often asked to do things by people that have no idea what they are even asking us to do! Our worth is often measured by our ability to crank out code at a record breaking pace, and our willingness to work insane amounts of hours doing so. Impossible deadlines are common. Work/life balance can often be non-existent. And as we all know, one øaww shitø can wipe out volumes of øatta-boyøsø. At the end of the day, itøs your job to produce, and unlike sales-people and executives, going above and beyond doesnøt often net you a trip to the Bahamas, a gold watch or a profit-sharing check. In fact, working harder usually only ends up raising others expectations of you, and when you fall short of that new bar you just set, you end up looking and feeling like a slacker.

øWhy did it take you so long to code that new feature? Why did QA find bugs in your code? Didnøt you even test anything? And why arenøt we using <insert latest beta technology here> in our app?ø

We, as programmers, are constantly being asked 'How long will it take'?

And you know, the situation is almost always like this:

The requirements are unclear. Nobody has done an in depth analysis of all the implications.
The new feature will probably break some assumptions you made in your code and you start thinking immediately of all the things you might have to refactor.
You have other things to do from past assignments and you will have to come up with an estimate that takes that other work into account.
The 'done' definition is probably unclear: When will it be done? 'Done' as in just finished coding it, or 'done' as in "the users are using it"?
No matter how conscious you are of all these things, sometimes your "programmer's pride" makes you give/accept shorter times than you originally suppose it might take. Specially when you feel the pressure of deadlines and management expectations.
Many of these are organizational or cultural issues that are not simple and easy to solve, but in the end the reality is that you are being asked for an estimate and they expect you to give a reasonable answer. It's part of your job. You cannot simply say: I don't know.

As a result, I always end up giving estimates that I later realize I cannot fulfill. It has happened countless of times, and I always promise it won't happen again. But it does.





As an engineering manager, you’ll need to put company first, team second and your team members third.

And I would also add: yourself as fourth. As an individual contributor I was used to this being the other way around: I would do my job first, then help my teammates whenever I could. Only after getting these out of the way would I look for doing things that would further help the team. I didn’t have to think too much of what’s good for the company - I usually assumed that whatever I’m doing is what the business needs.


What is engineering? I think of engineering as this: “Engineering is the application of an empirical, scientific approach to finding efficient solutions to practical problems.” This is a broad definition, but there are some subtleties here. It is empirical; we need to measure things and react to what we learn and adapt based on the ways in which our discoveries change our understanding. It is based on a scientific, rational approach to problem-solving. We need to carry out experiments, try out ideas, and discard the ones that don’t work. The solutions that we find need to be efficient, not just in terms of performance, but also in terms of being cost-effective.

So what is software engineering? I think that a good starting definition involves these principles of software engineering: It’s iterative It employs feedback It’s incremental It’s experimental It’s empirical




	I guess I fell asleep on my career. Now I am waking up and realizing that Iøve wasted close to fifteen years in a job that probably never deserved me. Iøve wasted years working for a bad manager who never saw me as a person, only a piece in his machine. I have a lot of conflicting feelings. On the one hand Iøm excited about the future. This past year I lost weight and everyone says I look stronger and healthier. I definitely feel that way. At the same time I feel guilty about falling asleep on my career. I feel a lot of anger and resentment about the way my company has treated me. Through all these feelings, I have to figure out what I want to do next, brand myself and get my job search going. Do you have advice for me?

Here are ten reasons talented people stay in awful jobs: 1. The job is close to your home. 2. You like the people you work with. 3. It seems like a pain to job-hunt. 4. You fear that you might be too old to change jobs or careers. 5. You are stuck and feel like you canøt move. 6. You have people in your life telling you øItøs a good job ø who cares if you like it or not? Keep the job!ø 7. You havenøt job-hunted in years and arenøt sure how to go about it. 8. You like small things about the job, like the fact that you have a desk near the window. 9. You feel too tired after a long day at work to pursue a job search or think about your career. 10. Youøve been asleep ø but are now waking up! The minute your internal alarm clocks goes off to tell you øWake up, now! Your life needs your attentionø you will see how one or more of these common obstacles kept you stuck. Thatøs okay.



ur responsibility is to take the initiative. Be intentional with the time allocated by your 1:1 weekly meetings with your manager. Start by creating an agenda with three core sections: project updates, challenges you’re encountering  (roadblocks) and ideas you may have that contribute to your team’s success. This gives you a starting point to think through



94. 	You look down at your to-do list and your heart starts racing. Why? Youøve just had that brutal realization that there is absolutely no way youøre going to be able to get everything done. Even if you shut your office door, skip happy hour, pull an all-nighter, and crank up your most inspirational productivity playlist, there will still be unfinished tasks lingering on that pesky list of yours. Put simply, youøve over-promisedømeaning youøve found yourself over-extended and totally overwhelmed. Now what? What can you realistically do, other than put your head down on your desk and silently resent your ridiculous workload?

	Put simply, weøre pretty bad at understanding how long things take us. We all fancy ourselves productivity superheroes and thus grossly underestimate just how long a project will take us to complete. Plenty of studies exist to back this fact up. Researchers wanted to see the planning fallacy in actionøso, they conducted an experiment by asking students for an estimate of when theyød complete an academic project. Basically, the students were asked to assign a confidence interval of 50%, 75%, and 99% to a time when they thought theyød have the task finished. At the point in time when students said they were 99% certain theyød have the project completed? In reality, only 45% of them had it done.


	Hey Jamie, I wanted to touch base and let you know that Iøm pretty swamped right now. Iøm doing my best to catch up. But, unfortunately, I wonøt be able to have that client rundown completed for you by the end of the week as originally discussed. Iøm hoping that we can push that deadline back a bit, as Iød always rather turn in high-quality work a little behind schedule than shoddy work on time. Would next week Wednesday work to have it submitted to you? Let me know if that adjusted timeline works on your end. Thanks,




93. Every day, ask “What’s a better way to do this?”

Every time you feel a twinge of frustration with a process at home or at work, make a note of it.

There are constant opportunities for process improvements around us, but we often tune them out.

Don’t be afraid to change tiny things in your routine, and to stay open to process innovations that come into your awareness from any source at all.

Rather than smashing through twenty To Do items at the ground level, stop and ask “Do all of these tasks still make sense?” Get altitude on your day, and your To Do list. That’s what they mean when they say “Don’t work harder — work smarter!”





92. Even if you don’t want a job with Amazon, you should still improve your behavioral interviewing skills. 

Today, every job is temporary. The chances are high you will need to interview multiple times in your lifetime. Moreover, behavioral interviewing is a widespread technique used by thousands of recruiters and hiring managers. Knowing how to respond to behavioral questions will improve the chances you make a good impression and beat out the competition for the job you want.

Waiting until the night before an interview to prepare is like cramming for the final exam — it can end badly. Besides, getting the interview is even more challenging these days; do you really want to blow it because you failed to learn to tell interviewers what they need to hear to hire you?





91. 3 phrases that will kill your business

"We've always done it that way"

"It's not my job"

"We can't"




90. To avoid these pitfalls, the design firm IDEO has developed a brainstorming strategy that relies on three simple words: the phrase øHow might we.ø

At a recent creative leadership class at the firmøs office in New York City, put on by Adobeøs 99U conference, nearly every question was framed as a øHow might we,ø or HMW: How might we make our teams more engaged? How might we foster deeper relationships between employees? How might we inspire more frequent knowledge-sharing? The same approach is popular at Google and Facebook, according to the Harvard Business Review.

While the phrase øHow might weø seems pretty basic, each word is intended to serve a specific purpose. øHowø asks employees to be descriptive, ømightø suggests there are good answers, but not a single correct answer, and øweø evokes inclusivity and teamwork, says Duane Bray, IDEOøs global head of talent.





89. Ask your peers for more feedback. Feedback is a gift given to you by others, not an obligation. If you don’t think the feedback you’re getting is helpful, it’s your responsibility to ask for more. If someone tells you, “You’re doing great,” press for more details. “What I could be doing to better solve Problem X?” “How can I do a better job presenting at critique?” “What’s something I should be doing more of?”

88. My biggest career mistake was never jumping ship to another employer. As a headhunter, I constantly warn candidates against the perils and drawbacks of taking a counteroffer. Alas when the shoe was on the other foot, I violated my own advice to my candidates: I took a counteroffer instead of moving with another firm to start a division in a different state.

Although I ended up retiring from my 9ø5 anyways at age 28, I still harbor a regret for never having taken the plunge to work for another employer. I always wonder what my life would be like had I moved to another city to run my own headhunting team. It would have been fun to experience corporate life with another company.






87. Value #1: Embrace change

He told me that many people are too conservative in their careers.

Often young peopleøøøespecially those who make good moneyøøøare scared to change industries, roles, companies, cities, organizational structures, or career paths.

People miss worthwhile opportunities because their fear of failure blinds them from seeing the potential upsides.

This made me think of many of my former coworkers back at Google, who had ideas for startups but were reluctant to take the plunge.

His advice was to øembrace change and feel comfortable with it. Much of the technology we use today will be discarded in the future, and that is OK.ø


86. As a developer, your time is scarce, and reading a book takes up a lot of that time. You could be programming. You could be resting. But instead youøre allocating precious time to read and expand your skills.
So which book should you read? My colleagues and I often discuss books, and Iøve noticed that our opinions on a given book vary wildly.


85. What attributes would you use to describe your all-time favorite employees? 

t: Lack of drama. These favorite employees donøt complain. They donøt seek attention. They donøt gossip. They simply perform their jobs without a need to draw attention to their professional or personal challenges. They donøt see a need to remind others of how challenging the task might be. They donøt call attention to the fact that someone else didnøt complete their task.

Most highly valued employees not only perform their jobs admirably ø with skill, focus, and passion ø they do so in a way that demonstrates their commitment, first and foremost, to the work.ø

Top employees donøt just talk about ideas or identify problems. Rather, they always focus on how to accomplish the task at hand. These talented individuals know that there is a big difference between having intention and getting things done. The most valued employees know that nothing matters until it is implemented and achieving results.

Top employees donøt wait around to be told what to do. Once they know the goal and they are self-motivated to move toward that goal each day. Nothing will get in their way. Some might see them as stubborn. Most see them as possessing superpowers.

Their greatest superpower is the ability to receive and internalize feedback. They have sufficient confidence and self-awareness to accept constructive criticism as a way to improve, without seeing the input as negative.


84. Youøve been combing through the Internet for months, looking for positions that speak to you, your skills, and your passions. But every time you see something that could be it, you start second-guessing yourself, thinking up all the reasons why you wouldnøt be a good fit: you donøt have enough experience. You donøt have the right degree. Your skills donøt perfectly align with what this position requires.

What just happened? Do you see what you are doing? Do you realize that you can be your worst enemy?

Shanelle was holding Shanelle back.

Sound familiar?

The thoughts, words, and actions you use on yourself have the power to block your movement and cripple youøor to propel you forward. Weøre all on a journey to our best and highest self, which includes happiness in your chosen career. But in order for us to get there, we have to believe that itøs actually possible and available to us and have the confidence that weøre good enough. If youøre guilty of these three self-defeating thoughts, you could be holding yourself back from reaching your full potential.

1. øIøm not qualified.ø 

Ask yourself: if the worst happens, what will my life look like? Sometimes we scare ourselves to death thinking about all the things that might happen that we never even get started or we never even realize how the øworst scenarioø isnøt so bad.

3. øIøm comfortable here.ø Just like that spot in your bed or the soft sofa you plop onto after a long week, comfortable things have a way of making you lazy. But if you want to fulfill the purpose you have been put on this earth to do, you have to get out of the comfort zone of complacency and apathy. Many times you know this is not the job you want for the rest of your life, but you have gotten comfortable with the benefits, leave policy, co-workers, predictable work, and even the monotony of nothing ever changing. Itøs a slippery slope, though. If youøre unhappy at your job, itøs going to affect so many other areas of your life negatively. Until you move out of this comfortable place, you will never be satisfied, fulfilled, or even happy getting up on Monday mornings to go back to that place where you know nothing will ever change.


83. Any person lucky enough to have had one great teacher who inspired, advised, critiqued, and had endless faith in her studentøs ability will tell you what a difference that person has made in her life. øMost students who become interested in an academic subject do so because they have met a teacher who was able to pique their interest,ø 


82. Solve your own problems
Stop going to startup events, avoid startup coaches
Learn code by doing and searching on Google
Avoid courses, bootcamps, books, startup coaches
Do the simplest thing that could possibly work with your current skills (e.g. do not waste time on super cool new frameworks like React that will take you a year to learn)
Do it yourself (DIY)


81. The field of software in particular is always changing and evolving, so the odds are you might need to learn a new language, framework, platform, or technology every decade or so just to have job opportunities available.

But, to say that one language, skill, framework, or platform is key is giving you bad advice. If you learn web stuff today and soon all the opportunity is in VR, well you might be out of luck because you put all your chips on the web.

I donøt bet on a technology or a skill to get me by. I have a system.

My system is to paint every day and improve my skills. Sometimes I am working on learning a language, framework, or platform. Sometimes itøs design, management, leadership, marketing, or other obscure things.

It all adds up to me being more valuable and employable over time.

Continuous self improvement and learning is the real skill to master. A particular technology or focus is just a detail.


80. Focus on one message, one solution you want to get across. The problem I see is most people go in focused on themselves and what they want, whether it’s a pay raise, promotion or something else. You need to go in thinking about your boss. What is their biggest problem right now? What is the one problem they have? If you don’t know it, find out. People don’t like being sold to, but they like having their problems solved. If you focus on one message, you could say ‘What if I could show you a way to save 23% of time on doing a task. Is that of interest to you?’ That is the core message.”

79. High quality in software is widely agreed to include the following properties.

High-quality software:

Is modular.
Is loosely-coupled.
Has high cohesion.
Has a good separation of concerns.
Exhibits information hiding.


78. he broke engineers into two basic archetypes: the stables and the volatiles.

Stables-- the Vogons


He gave a description of stables as follows:

Happily work with direction
Appreciate that there appears to be a plan
Like schedules
Play nice with others
Value efficiently run no-drama teams
Calmly assess risk
Carefully work to mitigate failure (however distant or improbable it might be)
Tend to generate process because the know process creates predictability and measurability
If I were to give a caricature of this type, it would be the Vogons from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

Volatiles-- the cowboys


And here's how he described volatiles:

Prefer to define strategy rather than follow it
Cannot conceive of failing
Find thrill in risk
Often don't build predictable or stable things, but they sure build a lot
Often are only reliable if it's in their interest
See working with others as time-consuming and onerous
Prefer to work in small, autonomous teams
Could care less how you feel



77. 1. Prioritize the goals of code reviews with your team

Set up a time to talk with your team members about the primary goals of code reviews. If youøre trying to use code reviews to enforce stylistic consistency, but your teammates are counting on your eyes to catch bugs, neither of you will get the most out of a code review. If you all agree on the purpose of the code review you will be able to spend your time more efficiently.

My favorite purposes of code reviews are

To help me learn how to think like my coworkers so that I can more easily navigate and change the code.
To spread knowledge of what files and features have changed recently so that when bugs sneak in, at least two people can help with diagnosing and fixing the problem. No one should ever be alone on a team.
My least favorite purposes of code reviews are

Catching bugs. I think automated tests and using the app are much better ways to find out how code actually runs.
Enforcing basic style rules. I think linters are much better for this. Why waste a humanøs time on something a computer does better? Plus, getting a bunch of negative and unimportant comments can undermine feelings of teamness and trust.

77. 2. Run the app and try playing with the feature

Reading code is a pretty unnatural way to interact with code. Finding bugs just by reading takes years of practice. The computer is much better at running code than your head is.

Chances are, if you run the app, you will do something slightly different than what the author tried when testing their change. You may discover important cases they missed.

77. 4. Do code reviews as soon as you see the request

Even if it looks like a large review, try to make a first pass as soon as possible. Your coworkers will be grateful, and their goodwill will help you grow faster as a reviewer.

It isnøt always easy to do code reviews immediately, especially if they change a lot of code or it takes a long time to start up your app. If you find yourself procrastinating on code reviews these tips might help you get started faster:

Set a time limit, like half an hour. On your first pass, spend that half hour trying to understand the change and writing down questions. If at the end of the time limit you think you can approve the change, approve the change. If you arenøt ready, send the author any thoughts or questions you have so far, and schedule and commit to a time when you intend to do a more detailed pass and approve or request changes.

77. 5. Imagine how you would make this change before you read it

Read the feature description first, and try to make a list of the files you expect to change. Then, review the files the author actually changed. If theyøre different than what you expected, figure out why. Some files may have been changed by accident, or there might be a chance to learn about the code base. Testing yourself like this is a good way to practice for implementing similar features.


77. 7. Always give approval, unless you can prove that there is a bug

When you suggest changes, assume that the author can handle the changes. Slowing them down to wait for a second round of code review is almost never worth it, especially if the changes are simple things like renaming variables or extracting a duplicated method.

If you make authors wait longer because of style, the code will get worse in the long run. Slowing down changes makes people reluctant to submit small changes that clarify and clean the code.


76. DRY helps in writing code that is more maintainable. When you do a change to your codebase you donøt want to change the same code in 15 different places, or worse change it in 14 and forget 1 that causes a bug 3 months down the line. Having said that (and I hate saying that because it makes me feel like one of those cliched øconsultantsø) it depends, sometimes itøs ok to have duplicated code. If the cost for removing the duplication leads to an overly complex abstraction that is not worth it, itøs fine to leave the code the way it is.

Write unit tests, they could prove to be invaluable, especially when you introduce changes to your codebase. When you discover a bug or an edge case, write a unit test for it, trust me you will thank your past-self later at some point. Sometimes I use TDD for certain components of the system Iøm working on. I believe certain types of problems lend themselves nicely to Test-Driven Design, others donøt. Again, try to be balanced, donøt be dogmatic ø be pragmatic. Always try to use the best tools for the job.

Try to leave the codebase cleaner than you found it, remove dead code, or the thing I really loathe commented-out code, you have source-control for that, just remove it.


75. I just work basically because I get paid really well and it's a very challenging job. I honestly don't care that it's repetitive and monotonous - what I care about is me having a stable job and could provide for myself. I didn't know what I wanted to do after I graduated college so I took Information Systems as my Bachelors. It's pretty good so far!

In my spare time, I like to play games, hang out with friends, and go to concerts. I'd probably open an article or two about programming but nothing really to the point that I'll download the whole package and start testing/experimenting with code. I love having the free time wherein I could just focus on what I want to do with live, focus on my relationships, and focus on the future.

I've been working for almost 5 years now and I like it. Whenever I do a good job or get something out in production that runs smoothly (after bug fixes of course lol), it feels satisfying. Plus, coding keeps me busy and productive at work.


74. Instead, as soon as I've added a feature, if I find myself itching to try it out by hand, I've learned to recognize that urge, pause, and step back and write an automated test covering whatever behavior I was about to execute by hand.

Manual testing is often quick and easy and satisfying – you can directly test your application, one can see the results immediately on your screen, and one can interact with the application "for real", instead of in the sometimes-awkward scripted/mocked mode of unit tests. It's a very natural instinct.

However, it's also largely-wasted effort! A manual test only verifies the current state of the code base. As soon as you make a change, you've started to invalidate the results. If, however, you take the effort to encode the test in code as an automated test, it continues to be valid indefinitely into the future.


73. Iøve worked at my current job (MEGACORP) for over 3 years now; the work life balance is nil here and people embrace and expect the workaholic lifestyle. The work itself is also unedifying, if it werenøt for personal projects I probably wouldnøt have learned anything new for months.

I have tried to apply to jobs and interview but no luck so far finding something that is a good fit. Working years here churning the same legacy systems have eroded my hard technical knowledge. Iøve tried to take night classes for certificates so I can pivot/revive my career but itøs HARD. After a day at this job and six hours of meetings/conference calls, I am mentally drained.

All this I could perhaps tolerate, but the new management is a micromanaged nightmare that is reducing the amount of technical work, and consecutive all-nighters have been a regular thing since itøs now all about looking good to the executives, who I never get to present to. Management takes our work and feeds it up. I am healthy although last year my health definitely took a negative turn; Iøve been able to fix my exercise and diet and things are improving but Iøm not sure if I can keep it up a this job.

The pay and benefits are damn good for what I feel Iøm worth, but I wake up every day filled with dread and have to psych myself up blocking out the negative thoughts. My reviews have been consistently great but I feel like Iøm not going to be able to hack it much longer.

 I would like to take this time to travel a bit, study, polish up my own projects and build a portfolio, and take my time to find a good job where I like the work and culture. Despite being out of øinterview shapeø, Iøm still a hardworking and adequately smart person at my core, and I have confidence in my focus and discipline. But even as I draft my resignation letter, Iøm left with this unnerving feeling that Iøm missing something and this decision is going to wreck my life in a major way.

72. Guide to defensive programming

Never trust user input

Assume always youøre going to receive something you donøt expect. This should be your approach as a defensive programmer, against user input, or in general things coming into your system. Thatøs because as we said we can expect the unexpected. Try to be as strict as possible. Assert that your input values are what you expect.

Do whitelists not blacklists, for example when validating an image extension, donøt check for the invalid types but check for the valid types, excluding all the rest. In PHP however you also have an infinite number of open source validation libraries to make your job easier.

The best defense is a good offense. Be strict

Donøt reinvent the wheel

You donøt use a framework (or micro framework) ? Well you like doing extra work for no reason, congratulations! Itøs not only about frameworks, but also for new features where you could easily use something thatøs already out there, well tested, trusted by thousands of developers and stable, rather than crafting something by yourself only for the sake of it. The only reasons why you should build something by yourself is that you need something that doesnøt exists or that exists but doesnøt fit within your needs (bad performance, missing features etc)

Thatøs what is used to call intelligent code reuse. Embrace it

Write tests

We still need to say that ? Writing unit tests will help you adhering to common principles such as High Cohesion, Single Responsibility, Low Coupling and right object composition. It helps you not only testing the working small unit case but also the way you structured your objectøs. Indeed youøll clearly see when testing your small functions how many cases you need to test and how many objects you need to mock in order to achieve a 100% code coverage

71. I have taken big cuts in salary three or four times in my career. I’m talking 10-20 thousand dollars a year. And not because I was out of work. I left existing jobs because I did not see myself growing technically in those positions. I’ve also turned down big salary jobs because I felt they’d stifle my technical growth. Some of my job changes ended up, arguably, being bad choices as they ended up being dead ends, but I make sure that I always walk away from a project with accumulated and marketable knowledge.

I’ve seen too many people lock themselves into technologies (like Lotus Notes and Domino) and find themselves unmarketable after spending 10 years in that industry. Even if you have a high-paying salary, don’t let the tech world pass you by. Be sure to be up on the latest technologies. And, if you can’t do that at your current position, maybe it’s time to move on.


70. The longer you hunker down in a going-nowhere job, the less marketable you are on the inevitable day when you hit the talent market again! That’s why it is important to grow your muscles all the time.

You know how it is with muscles — when they aren’t growing, they’re getting soft!

The only job security we will ever have is the kind we build in ourselves — particularly by stepping into the unknown!


69. Why Use Test-Driven Development?

Writing tests seems like a lot of overhead. You have to learn the framework. You have to write a lot more codeømaybe even more test code than real code. Sure, this approach ensures that the code you write works, but you could do that by running your program and verifying it works, right?

The fact is, manually checking all edge cases can be a huge pain. Youøll save yourself a ton of time by writing tests that can be run every time you make a change to your codebase.

When I was in data structures and algorithms classes, I spent an absurd amount of time manually checking inputs to see if my code worked. There are so many places where your code can go wrong. And even after manually checking, I couldnøt be sure things worked perfectly. I remember walking into my professorøs office to have him test the function of my binary tree with a feeling of dread, knowing he would check every edge case in greater detail than I had. If only I had written tests!


68. When I hear someone say they have 20 years of experience, I wonder if thatøs really true or if they merely had 1 year of experience 20 times. Iøve known too many developers that used the same techniques they learned in their first year of employment for the entire span of their career. I found this to be true in the IBM AS/400 RPG marketplace with 40- and 50-year-olds, but Iøve also found it to be true with 30-something Java developers. I found was that most of them were still using old-school RPG. They had stopped enhancing their core skill set ø much less acquiring new ones. 

My point is certainly not that these younger developers were smarter. Itøs that many programmers let themselves grow stale. And the bigger problem is, after doing the same yearøs worth of experience ten times, many programmers forget how to learn. Not only can it be extremely hard to catch up with ten years of technology, it can be next to impossible if youøve forgotten how to learn.

If you plan on being in the IT field for more than 10 years, you need to be a lifelong learner. Iøve always been a lifelong learner. Iøve learned and developed with numerous programming languages, frameworks, and strategies. As a result, Iøve honed my learning skills. 


67. So how do you ødoø Modern Agile? I get that question a lot. What are the steps or prescriptions? Donøt we need more than just four principles?

Letøs say you decide you want to write a book. If you are driven by Modern Agile principles, youøll want to quickly discover if the book will make people awesome. It would not be a safe investment of your time if no one has interest in your book. So, to learn whether there is genuine excitement about your topic, youøll need to experiment and learn rapidly. To do that, youøll need to deliver some value to some people and learn rapidly from their response. Perhaps you write a few pages, a short chapter or a small article, receiving feedback from an inner circle and then from a wider audience. As you write and learn, youøll want to make sure your work is safe by using tools that protect your work by backing it up. If you are interviewing someone important for the book, you may want multiple recorders running, so if one breaks or runs out of space, youøll have built-in fault tolerance to ensure you get a good recording.



66. Failing fast and safely was integral to his success. Experiment & Learn Rapidly is a guiding principle of Modern Agile because it protects us from wasting time and helps us discover success faster.

We make our experiments øsafe to failø so we are not afraid to conduct more of them. A journalist once asked Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, about the Amazon FirePhone, a total flop. Without missing a beat, Mr. Bezos replied, øWe are working on much bigger failures right now.ø Mr. Bezos runs Amazon like a venture capital fund, which only needs to succeed big on a few bets in its portfolio to easily pay for all of its failures. Mr. Bezos is proud of Amazon being a safe place to fail.

When we get stuck or arenøt learning enough, we take it as a sign that we need to run more experiments. Speed is key with this principle. We donøt wait long periods of time before learning that something isnøt working. We fail fast and quickly move on to new experiments. Experimenting & learning rapidly helps us achieve continuous improvement.




65. I spend way too much time on Hacker News. It's a fun place, and a good way to keep up to date on all the new tech that us developer folk seem to need to know about. But it also leaves a fella feeling like he really needs to keep up with all this stuff. I mean, if you don't have a side project using the latest client-side framework, well, good luck ever finding a job again in this industry.


64. While Scrum drives productivity by limiting the work time available in a sprint, Kanban drives productivity and velocity by limiting the number of active, concurrent issues. Time estimation is no longer part of the process.

Velocity is still a major focus but now we optimize at an issue level, now called Cycle Time. Items to the right of the board, those furthest along, get higher priority. This creates an important core value on the team. Finish what weøre already working on, before you take on more work. Stop multi-tasking. Stop context shifting.

63. Structural Focus On Quality
A major, unplanned benefit of Kanban, was a focus on software quality. Under Scrum, there was always a temptation to cut corners in order to get things into the Sprint and then shove the missing work into the Tech Debt backlog, like skipping a code review, approving 70% code coverage when our standard is 95%, etc. Tech Debt kept getting bigger, and we missed some elements in designing new features. At Stormpath, we take code quality extremely seriously, so the constant risk made everyone uncomfortable.

Under Kanban, steps that ensure code quality are baked into the process. Since weøre rarely working against a deadline, thereøs rarely pressure to skip these steps. In fact, because engineering owns the process, thereøs a strong pressure to stick to the process. Engineers will fight to make sure we have 100% code review and 95%+ code coverage now.


62. øTaco Bell Programmingø is the idea that we can solve many of the problems we face as software engineers with clever reconfigurations of the same basic Unix tools. The name comes from the fact that every item on the menu at Taco Bell, a company which generates almost $2 billion in revenue annually, is simply a different configuration of roughly eight ingredients.

61. Many people grumble or reject the notion of using proven tools or techniques. Itøs boring. It requires investing time to learn at the expense of shipping code.  It doesnøt do this one thing that we need it to do. It wonøt work for us. For some reasonøand I continue to be completely baffled by thisøeveryone sees their situation as a unique snowflake despite the fact that a million other people have probably done the same thing. Itøs a weird form of tunnel vision, and I see it at every level in the organization. I catch myself doing it on occasion too. I think itøs just human nature.

I was able to come to terms with this once I internalized something a colleague once said: you are not paid to write code. You have never been paid to write code. In fact, code is a nasty byproduct of being a software engineer.


Every time you write code or introduce third-party services, you are introducing the possibility of failure into your system.

60. Weøre not paid to write code, weøre paid to add value (or reduce cost) to the business. Yet I often see people measuring their worth in code, in systems, in toolsøall of the output thatøs easy to measure. I see it come at the expense of attending meetings. I see it at the expense of supporting other teams. I see it at the expense of cross-training and personal/professional development. Itøs like full-bore coding has become the norm and weøve given up everything else.

59. QA/testing should always begin and continue from the start with development, and the whole app should always be tested not just the new things.
If there is anything I believe in it is this. I learned early on 30 years ago that having quality testers who worked with the development team from the first day anything functioned is an enormous benefit. Over time they understand the product better than any of the programmers do, they find all the dark corners, and can even help find UI/UX that is irritating. Compared to this knowledgeable testing, throw-it-over-the-wall testing (like we have at my present employer) is terrible. Generally the testers donít know much about your app, rely on potentially spotty documentation, communicate very little other than with ìticketsî and you have no time to fix anything.

58. Be liberal at the start of the project and conservative towards the end.
The time to take risks is at the start of a development cycle, assuming itís reasonably long. Thatís the time to try new tools or frameworks or languages. The closer you get to the end the less you should consider something new.

57. Maintaining independent modules allows for them to be changed without having to change the entire system. But that only works if the design rules are respected, and in the real world, many systems have design flaws, Dr. Kazman says.

øSoftware systems degrade,ø he explains. øThat means that over time, developers are going to spend more and more time and effort trying to make changes and fix bugs and deal with the accidental complexity that has accumulated. That means less energy goes into the actual business of your business, like adding features that your customers care about.ø

Because such degradation happens so incrementally it goes unnoticed, then ignored, until it reaches a crisis level that requires a concerted cleanup. øIt becomes the new normal and people just accept it,ø Dr. Kazman says. øA lot of the time, developers arenøt aware of the problems. They know they have a yucky feeling but donøt know exactly what to fix.ø

55. Deeply understand the business domain you’re working in. Imagine if instead of just working on what you’re assigned, you’re able to identify new strategic areas, projects, or tools for the business and work on those problems. You’d be able to deliver more impact with the same amount of engineering effort because you’re in a more valuable playing field. Your wins would be worth more. The way to getting that insight is by talking to your users — customers, clients, business units, sales teams, or internal teams — to gain a deeper understanding of what people want.

54. Increasing technical expertise, however, is not the only avenue for increasing your impact. And if youøre not in the top echelon of technical experts, a viewpoint that leads you to solely focus on deepening your technical skills can become a limiting mindset.

If instead, you broaden your mental model of an engineer as someone who solves real problems for users, you open up more opportunities for yourself. Ultimately what matters in terms of success and impact is not whether you can write the best code or solve the hardest technical problems but whether youøre creating value for people.

By thinking of engineers as problem solvers, you can start to ask yourself questions like:

What problem should I focus my energy on to maximize value for users?
How can I prioritize my work to deliver value sooner?
How can I reduce risk to improve the likelihood of success of what I work on?
How can I resolve conflicts with my teammates to build stronger working relationships so we can get more done?
How can I better communicate with my immediate team or with related business or sales teams to ensure smoother releases and launches?
How can I better ensure that users actually take advantage of the potential value of what Iøve built once itøs done?
Technical execution is only one step ø albeit an important one ø in a multi-stage process of creating value. 


56. So a quick note about me, I'm a manager at a mid-sized company and I oversee three tech teams with a combined payroll well into the millions. I have been interviewing candidates for many years; I've interviewed literally hundreds of people at all levels of experience, from freshly minted college grads to senior level pros.
I wanted to share something I noticed in the hopes it may help some of you folks who are getting ready to go out for your first tech job.
The advice is this: When picking the first place that you will work out of school, value the quality of the mentoring that you will be getting above almost all else.
Your first professional job is really an extension of your education. In fact, I'd go as far as to say your first two years on the job will be more important than the four years you spent in university. Your focus with the first job should be a place that will surround you with smart people, and a culture that encourages development of new talent. That way, even if the pay or field of work is not stellar, you will have a solid foundation on which to jump off to your next job.
I have done several interviews lately where the candidate had done great in school, but ended up at a small place where it was sort of everyone-for-themselves in terms of development. They had done well keeping the lights on there, but it was obvious that after three years on the job, they were exclusively self taught, which while admirable, does not mean they know the right way to do things. They are making mistakes that others have made before them, and will have take a lot of time learning lessons the hard way that others have already learned. Their solutions reek of layers of tactical fixes that will never grow, scale well, or handle changing requirements without a total re-do. They were passed over in favor of candidates who had been out of school the same amount of time, but demonstrated a solid foundation of the sort of things you can only really learn once you get into large scale projects with people who are going to take the time to explain how things should work.
If you are picking your first job based on salary, industry, or anything else without considering mentorship, you're potentially shooting yourself in the foot. Education is far from over when you get the diploma, base your first job pick on that fact.


53. Courage to Speak Up
In many, many work situations, the prevailing response among employees is to simply say nothing at all about workplace inefficiencies and challenges. Just keep your nose down, do your job, don’t talk about the problems, and most of all, don’t volunteer for anything.

Believe it or not, that’s actually the perfect way to make sure that you never earn another dime and never get a promotion. It makes sure that you stay unnoticed, and the unnoticed person doesn’t get raises. They don’t get promotions. They often lose out when it comes to hours.



51. That said, you are not unreasonable in wanting to be able to leave your mark on the software and wanting more meaningful work.

As a programmer, it is a fact of life that you will spend more time maintaining and modifying other people's code than you will writing your own from scratch. If this is a problem for you then perhaps you should stick to developing as a hobby and pursue a different career. If you are OK with maintaining code, but you feel you are not being used effectively or are being overwhelmed, then that is a matter you need to discuss with your manager. If your problems are more serious than that or if you feel like your managers don't know how to effectively manage your skill set then it would be a good idea to consider finding a position at a different company.

50. Additionally, you have to realize that to a company, having code that works is more important than having code that is clean. From your company's perspective, you changing the existing structure is money wasted on redoing something that is already done and potentally introducing even more errors. Usually these types of companies aren't computer/software companies so no sufficiently high manager has the technical background to know that sometimes you need to do these major overhauls. That said, if your company is run by technically competent people and they understand the value of good code, you may get more leeway, although sometimes you need to choose your battles (the main purpose of a business is still to make money, after all).


49. During one of my internships I found I spent a lot of time doing bug fixes. You have to realize that as an entry level employee you aren't going to get the sexiest work, you're going to get the grunt work no one else wants. It's unfortunate, but it's how it is at every job.

3.Wasting Time
You won’t believe how many evenings and weekends I’ve lost by watching tv, going out, pointless shopping, or whatever leisure activity.

Sure, entertainment is good, but you don’t have to relax every SINGLE free minute you have.

Look, this is your life, and this is your career. Take it seriously.



But instead of focusing on money; why not focus on other things that are more fulfilling? Things like learning, experience, doing work that you are interested in, adding value to other people’s li


48. Any engineer worth their pay can produce code that “works”; what distinguishes a superb engineer is that they can write maintainable code efficiently that supports a business long term, and have the skill to solve problems simply and in a clear and maintainable way.




47. 1) Defensive programming
The main purposes of defensive programming is to ensure that a piece of code works under unforeseen circumstances, to improve comprehension and predictability and to simplify maintenance.
To program defensively, make sure each method (as well as class, variable and property where applicable):
* Has a clear and single purpose
* Has a clear name with a clear intent (that matches the implementation)
* Does not have any unexpected side effects (i.e. it should not perform operations that is not to be expected)
* Is short and concise
* Is testable
* Validates input
* Handles exceptions
* Has a clear contract
* Has sensible return values
* Does not have any leaky abstractions (internal details and limitations should be kept internal)
* Use comments (with moderation) to explain why things are done (if you feel that you need to explain how something is done you should consider refactor the code instead)

Also, make sure that your code follows best practice guidelines, methodologies and programming techniques so that other programmers (and yourself after some time) easily can grasp how the code works.




46. Make MONDAYS Matter! I have always believed that you should do your best to get as MUCH work as possible done on the first day of the week. A busy Monday sets the tone for your week. You will be able to get feedback and have 4 work days to deal with it. If you typically go out of the office for lunch each day, make Monday the “work through” lunch day. You’ve had the entire weekend to lounge and relax. Make Monday #BEASTMODE so that if you have an “off” week you know you handled the shit out of Monday.

45. is really about one thing: reducing release cycle time. By cycle time, I mean the time involved in having an idea, getting that idea into the hands of our users, and gathering feedback. We should optimize our software development processes for that. Whatever it takes.

Defining cycle time more clearly

Imagine the simplest change to your production system that you can think of. You want it to be so simple that you can ignore the variable cost of development.

Now imagine that change going through all of the normal processes to get it prioritized, scheduled, defined, implemented, tested, verified, documented, and deployed into productionøevery step that a change to production would normally take. The time that it takes to complete all of those steps, plus the time that the change spends waiting between steps, is your cycle time. This is a great proxy term I use for measuring the time from "idea" to "valuable software in the hands of users."

I believe that if you take an empirical, iterative approach to reducing cycle time, then pretty much all of the benefits of agile development, lean thinking, DevOps, and continuous delivery practice will fall out as a natural consequence.

My experience with a 57-minute cycle time

I once worked on a complex, demanding, high-performance system that processes billions of dollars of other people's money on a daily basis. It included account management, public APIs, Web UIs, administration tools, multiple third-party integrations in a variety of different technologies, data warehouses, and a whole lot of other enterprise trappings. We had a cycle time of 57 minutes. In 57 minutes we could evaluate any change to our production system and, if all the tests passed, be in a position to release that change into the hands of users.

Now think about the consequences of being able to do that.

If you have a cycle time of 57 minutes, you can't afford the communications overhead of large teams. You need compact, cross-functional, efficient teams.

You can't afford the hand-offs that are implicit in siloed teams. If you divide your development effort up into technical specialisms, you will be too slow. You need cross-functional collaborative teams to ensure a continual flow of changes.

You can't rely on manual regression testing. You need a great story on automated testing. Human beings are too slow, too inefficient, too error prone, and too expensive.

You can't rely on manual configuration and management of your test and production environments. You need to automate the configuration management, automate deployment, and develop a good story on "infrastructure as code."

You can't have a cycle time of 57 minutes and have hand-offs between Dev and Ops.

You can't have a cycle time of 57 minutes if your business can't maintain a constant smooth flow of ideas.

You have to be very good at a lot of aspects of software development to achieve this kind of cycle time.
If you can confidently evaluate your changes to the point where you are happy to release changes into production in under an hour, without any further work, you are doing very well!



Optimizing for short cycle time drives good behaviors

You don't have to be great at every step in the release cycle before you start seeing the benefits of this mindset. Simply striving to improve your cycle time will help you (and, in some sense, force you) to improve your development process, culture, and technology. It will force you to address impediments and inefficiencies that get in your way. And the best part is that I've never seen this metric encourage bad behaviors.

Many people are nervous that reducing cycle time will reduce quality. In my experience, and in countless experiences I've heard about throughout the industry, I've found that the reverse is true.

What happens is that by reducing cycle time you reduce batch-size. By reducing batch-size, you reduce the risk of each change (ever heard of colleagues warning against "big bang" releases?). Each change becomes simpler and lower-risk. 66% of organizations that claim to practice continuous delivery say that quality goes up, not down (according to the 2015 CA Technologies DevOps Survey). Personally, I'm not sure what the other 34% are doing wrong ;-)


48. Tips to become better developer

- I am a firm believer that the next thing you need to know is how to properly structure your code. I mean to write good, clear, understandable code that doesnøt require a large amount of comments because the code itself is communicative.

Many software developers go through their whole career without learning this skill, and itøs unfortunate because this is the primary way Iøand many othersøjudge the skill and competence of a software developer.

Structuring your code is really the art part of software development, but itøs also critical because you and your co-workers who have to work with your code will spend considerably more time maintaining existing code rather than writing new code.

Iøm not going to go into how to properly structure your code in this book sinceølike I saidøIøve already provided you with an excellent resource, but you should strive to learn how to write good, clean code from the beginning rather than learn this skill afterwards.

- This one is debatable, especially if you are learning a program language that isnøt object oriented (OO), but enough of the software development world thinks in terms of OO design, so you need to make sure you understand it.

Object oriented design is a way of designing complex programs that breaks them down into individual classes or objects (instantiations of classes), which encapsulate functionality and have specific roles and responsibilities.

In software development, we are always trying to manage complexity.

Thinking in terms of objects helps us do that because it allows us to define and design a complicated system out of a bunch of interacting components, rather than trying to tackle the entire complexity as a whole.

- There are many of these algorithms in the field of computer science, and it is also important to understand how to write your own variations of these algorithms to solve the kind of tricky problems you might encounter when solving real programming problems.

Often, being good with algorithms can allow one developer to solve a problem in an hour that might take another developer several days to figure out.

Data structures fall into a similar category and work in conjunction with algorithms.

There are several data structures all software developers should be familiar with including:

Arrays or vectors
Linked lists
Stacks
Queues
Trees
Hashes
Sets
By having a good grasp of data structures and algorithms, you can easily and elegantly solve many difficult programming problems.


- Even though the landscape of databases has changed quite a bit in the last few years, I donøt see databases going away any time soon, so I think you probably should know a thing or two about them, donøt you?

At the time of writing this book, there are two main database technologies: relational databases and document databases.

I would say that a developer today should at least be familiar with relational databases and probably should have some understanding of document databases as well.



22. But my work – the work we lucky few well-paid professionals do every day, as we co-operate with talented people while solving complex, interesting problems – is fun. And I find that I can devote surprising quantities of time to it.
I didn’t want more time to myself; I wanted to feel pushed to be better and achieve more. It wasn’t the stress of being on the fast track that caused my chest to tighten and my heart rate to rise, but the thought of being left behind by those still on it.
me. They are asking about a job. I am thinking about identity, community, purpose – the things that provide meaning and motivation. I am talking about my life.



21. leave the code in better shape than it was when you found it.


20. Initiative

You want staff members who are problem solvers and who are constantly looking for ways that processes can be improved. But more than that, you want to identify people who will act on those ideas. People who will pitch a process improvement to a manager or develop a plan that makes something easier for coworkers. Having innovative ideas is not enough. It’s taking the initiative to make those ideas a reality that will lead to success.



11. Maintainability

Maintaining source code takes at least twice as long when maintainability is below average (as measured by SIG). If code is not maintainable changes to the codebase are risky and easily introduce bugs. This can even lead to the system being written off before initial release.

I think the most important lesson is that maintainability is not an afterthought: you need to start early and have the discipline to make every contribution (commit) count. The book mentions the ìBoy Scoutsî rule that says ìleave the campground cleaner than you found it.î


16. Small teams frequently outperform large team, five people working as a tight team will be far more productive per person than a team of 50, or even 15. (The Quattro Pro development team in the early 1990s is probably the best documented example of this.)
The more lines of code a piece of software has the more difficult it is to add an enhancement or fix a bug. Putting a fix into a system with 1 million lines can easily be more than 10 times harder tha

12. Write shorter units of code

Shorter units (that is, methods and constructors) are easier to analyze, test, and reuse.

The book prescribes a simple rule: methods of 15 lines or less.

13. Write simpler units of code

Units with fewer decision points are easier to analyze and test.

14. 4. Keep unit interfaces small (Chapter 5)

Units (methods and constructors) with fewer parameters are easier to test and reuse.

A valuable lesson here is to keep list of parameters to a method small, I found this in my code which is relatively complex:

15. Autoomate development pipeline and tests (Chapter 10)

Automated tests (that is, test that can be executed without manual intervention) enable near-instantaneous feedback on the effectiveness of modifications. Manual tests do not scale.

Here I need to get a bit more into the TDD-habit yet. I have been adding tests being late in the development cycle, ideally you do this when writing the code or even drive your design by testing, because you get in the habit of thinking about how your code can be tested. The immediate feedback and safety net of a regression suite, makes you less afraid to make changes which is an important requirement with ever-changing business rules.





1. Be Wary of High Performers

Undoubtedly youøve identified some of the developers on your team as high performers. These are the developers that tend to get work done quickly. Managers often choose and prefer these developers for projects in order to increase the odds of meeting aggressiveøøøand frequently artificialøøødeadlines.

Actual high performers are rareøøøvery rare. You probably donøt have one on your team. You might think you do but youøre almost certainly wrong.

Odds are far better than good that your high performers are achieving what appears to be high levels of productivity by building technical debt into the application by taking shortcuts whether intentionally or unintentionally. Examples of shortcuts are not taking the time to design and architect things well at all levels (low to highøøøthink objects and object hierarchies, database schema changes, etc.), failing to test adequately, and crafting code that is hard to read, maintain and extend.

These kinds of high performers are actually low performers when when TCO is factored in. Unless youøre a startup where time to market is the highest priority, keep these kinds of developers under close scrutiny with extensive design and code reviews.


1. Encourage Continual Product Improvement

Encourage developers to improve the application while working on their projects. Examples of improvements are creating reusable objects out of copypasta code and breaking up large objects that are difficult to maintain into smaller objects that individually are easier to reason about. Improve the database schema even if it hurts in the short term. Delete old and unused code. With the benefit of hindsight update the user interface to improve user experienceøøøsometimes even just changing a word or two makes a big difference.

Developers that become accustomed to doing continual improvement tend to be happier developers because continual improvement gives them autonomy and a strong sense of making valuable contributions on their own terms. Donøt underestimate the morale boost.

Continual improvement isnøt a stand alone project. If you make it a stand alone project youøll eventually find a reason to abandon it entirely because itøs impacting deadlines. It should be something developers are tasked to do all the time during their normal development activities. This is not unlike the power of compound interest. Continual improvement will eventually snowball into astonishing results.

2. Encourage Code Ownership
   

At the start of your career, chances are good that you'll be hired primarily for your "hard skills"øthe stuff you know that's relevant for the job. When youøre fresh out of college or even a few years into your career, things like what software youøve mastered, the knowledge you've picked up during internships and in school, and your other technical credentials really matter.

But what no one quite tells you is that while you might've been initially hired for those hard skills, they gradually matter less. The further you get in your career, the less you'll be evaluated on those same skillsøand this is especially important once you reach your mid-career point. Why? Because the hard skills that got you the job won't be the ones that get you promoted.




Your time is precious, save as much of it as you can. Automate everything. Once your time is a commodity, you can achieve your next great innovation. If you find yourself doing things frequently, make them happen in one button press, or one click. Or better yet, make them happen automatically.


Optimizing last - It's easy to fall into the trap of trying to be more clever than the users or the computer, and pre-optimize for all kinds of edge cases.  Focus on the Pareto Principle (80% of the effect comes from 20% of the work).  Write code, run code, and focus on the biggest bottlenecks when it becomes necessary.  This also supports keeping codebases simple.

Saying "Don't optimize first" isn't saying "Write sloppy code".  You always want to write lean and elegant code, but you don't want to spend your entire day trying to squeeze the last 10% out of something that worked well enough already.  Your productivity drops, you introduce more complexity, solutions become less generalizable, etc.

Understanding the full stack I made a conscious decision to understand the full stack.  I knew I wouldn't be the best at everything, or ultimately the only person responsible for everything, but I wanted to be able to make end-to-end prototypes because I'm impatient to see progress.

Every time I needed something that touched an area I didn't understand, I researched it.  I learned server administration, database administration, design, front-end/back-end development, cloud architectures, etc.

By understanding what the other roles do, I'm able to write code that's conscious of their needs as well.


15. And so we get peer feedback, write tests, and get code reviews, all in the hopes of overcoming our inevitable failures:

"My design isn't great," you think. So you talk it over with a colleague and together you come up with an even better idea.
"My code might have bugs," you say. So you write tests, and catch any bugs and prevent future bugs.
"My code might still have UI problems," you imagine. So you manually test your web application and check all the edge cases.
"I might have forgotten something," you consider. So you get a code review, and get suggestions for improving your code.



On working extra hours:

. Working hard at your job does not get you much. When you work hard at a job where the boss doesnøt value your efforts, all your hard work gets you is taken for granted. Just working hard by itself will exhaust you and shorten your lifespan without any benefits to you.

If you are at work right now, think about the investment of time and energy you are making. Imagine that you only went home to sleep for four hours a night, and gave up all the rest of your personal time to get more work done. Imagine that you practically lived at your desk and worked your tail off for the next five years. What would that extraordinary effort get you?

If youøre working for a fixed salary or hourly wage the way most people are, you wonøt see economic benefits from pouring your energy into your job. Your boss may be grateful to you for all your extra effort, but he or she is not going to give you a pay raise every month just because youøre putting in extra hours.

 You could donate every waking hour to your job and still get a one percent pay bump at the end of the year, or get laid off when the company realizes that youøve solved all of their biggest problems and they donøt need you anymore.

On Growth:

He also says that hiring managers should observe what he calls horizon, the individualøs ability to look beyond the current task and the immediate situation to the additional considerations that a manager should demonstrate: a vision for the future and the ramifications of that vision as well as an understanding of how to implement big-picture thinking.


1. Technical Debt

I think the self-perpetuating cycle of poverty applies to software teams as well. An overloaded team cannot afford to refactor, learn a new technology or tool, spend time architecting things correctly, review security practices, or abstract things into new libraries etc. The only thing that the team can do is struggle to complete today's items, exhausting even their internal reserves of stamina. Without being able to pause, reflect, reconsider, and improve, the only way is down. This is not just about technical debt. It's also about exploiting opportunities for shortcuts that require some upfront cost.

It also strikes me that "Agile" and "Scrum" as practiced in large companies today is a fantastic way to get into the software development poverty trap. Thinking of nothing else than the completion of the current goals as set by the business stakeholders means that every next "sprint" will make things worse and worse.

Considering the software development poverty trap, it becomes more obvious that at almost all times, a significant part of a team's energy should be getting reinvested in improving the team's productivity. A team that does this will not only have a better experience at work, but will deliver more, deliver better, and have the results be more useful over time. What may seem like a waste on the micro level is the difference between success and failure on the macro level.

 A team that invests in its own productivity will deliver more software, faster.
 All too often we preach the gospel of software and automation but fail to apply it to our own way of work



“Never memorize something that you can look up.” - Albert Einstein



Ask 'why' five times about every matter."


In fact itøs difficult to even know how bad your estimations are. After all you are trying to guess how long something will take that is not perfectly defined to be done by imperfect people in circumstances that are likely to change in a generally continuous fashion. If it takes longer than you estimated, was it because your estimation was wrong or because you did not have enough information when you started or because the estimation time became a deadline that changed the development process itself? Software development is an iterative activity, where each step influences the following ones. Outside influences like management demands, market changes, personal changes and external changes like tools or framework updates all have an effect on how you get to the finish line.


et management insisted of detailing every last item. We met weekly for 6 months and a 150 page document was generated to substantiate how long it would take. In that time the project could have been done 10 times over. Sometimes it takes longer to gather enough knowledge up front to make a credible estimate than it is to simply make a wild guess and implement it, then iterate until you get what you want.



When Dan Pink published his bestselling book "Drive" in 2009, he wrote about the importance of cultivating in your employees a sense of purpose.

In other words, people should feel that they're making a difference in the world and acting in the service of something larger than themselves.


For example, a manager might tell an employee: "Your crunching those numbers and figuring out the mistake that we made really saved the day because so-and-so would have gone into that presentation with some wrong numbers, and we might have had to correct it after the fact."

Again, you don't have to make the employee feel as though they solved a global crisis. But taking the time to acknowledge how and why they contributed to the company can make a huge difference.

"It could be a presentation about effective rutabaga production — not anything transcendent," Pink added. "But basically, 'you saved the day. You mattered.'"



Barbara always says you should start a business because you found a solution to a problem. Do you agree with her, or should you follow your passion?

Herjavec: I completely agree but will take it a step further. You have to have a customer, otherwise you wonøt have a business for long. People are way too afraid to reach out and cold call a customer or get their opinion. Without customers you wonøt survive so make sure youøre actually solving a problem yes. But even more so, make sure that people care youøve solved it for them and want to buy whatever youøre selling.

All my life I’ve specialized in writing even complex apps (mostly client facing) quickly. It’s not easy to do unless you can control the process, the people, the decision making and have support from whoever is in charge so it’s not always possible. People love to complicate development with too much process, too much perfection, too many approvals and make everything take so long that no one wants to do it again so the code lives far too long until it becomes concrete.

Not everything is code you can rewrite every two years, but when the underlying technology is changing at an ever increasing rate, spending too much time on any one thing can put you seriously behind everyone else. In hyper competitive markets you need to be able to keep up or wind up being shut down. I’ve always been a big fan of Good Code Fast—deliver what the customer needs at the level of quality and design they expect but get it done quickly. If you can somehow deliver it fast, you have the ability to change and take advantage of those new things before someone else does.


We aren't in business to make perfect code. We are in business to sell hard drives.

What is the worst mistake an entrepreneur can make?

Herjavec: The same one twice.
If you want to boost your professional value and build a better career, youíll want to diversify and hone your skills. Personal finance writer David Carlson suggests periodically searching job postings to learn which skills are in demand.


No job is secure. Even if a job were secure, why would that make it the best job for you? The best job is the one where your muscles keep growing and your flame keeps growing, too.

You learn more at the right job and your confidence will grow the most. The wrong job will make your muscles atrophy, because that’s what happens to muscles when you don’t use them.

You’ll run your career not by looking for a hidey-hole where you can disappear from now until your imaginary retirement, but by seeking out new learning opportunities and stepping out of your comfort zone!


I credit the fact that I didn’t know what the hell I was setting myself up for for a lot of the success of Linux. If I had known what I know today when I started, I would never have had the chutzpah to start writing my own operating system: You need a certain amount of naïveté to think that you can do it. ... 

In his book, Hustle Away Debt, Carlson says regularly looking at job openings can help you build the skills and experience you need in advance. This is obviously helpful if youíre planning to quit, but really, itís useful even if you like your job. Learning new skills only adds value to your position, which puts you at an advantage when it comes time to ask for a raise or negotiate a promotion.

Sorry, but at the risk of ruining that martini: maybe not. We chronically confuse the feeling of effort with the reality of results—and for anyone working in a creative field, that means the constant risk of frittering time and energy on busywork, instead of the work that counts.

Psychologists have long noticed what’s sometimes been called the “labor illusion:” when it comes to judging other people’s work, we might say we’re focused only on whether they did the job quickly and well—but really we want to feel they wore themselves out for us.

The behavioral economist Dan Ariely tells the story of a locksmith, who, as he got better at his work, started getting fewer tips, and more complaints about his prices. Each job took him so little time or effort that customers felt cheated—even though, pretty obviously, being super-fast is an asset in a locksmith, not a fault.


Don't fear new technology or changes in the industry. You have to keep up (my favorite Technology Steamroller metaphor chasing you down) every day, at least learn something. New ideas, new languages, new frameworks, new platforms; you never know what new thing might lead you to something you would like even better. New isn't always better of course, sometimes new happens way to fast (thankfully I'm not a Javascript programmer), but new always provides opportunity. If you don't learn anything new, eventually you not only will hate your job you might not even have one anymore!



In 2011, a study [pdf link] by the Harvard Business School researchers Ryan Buell and Michael Norton found that people using a flight-search website actually preferred to wait longer for search results—provided they could watch a detailed progress display to see the site “working hard” to canvas each airline’s database.

This would be no more than an intriguing quirk of consumer behavior—if it weren’t for the fact that we apply the same twisted standards to ourselves. Call it the “Effort Trap:” it’s dangerously easy to feel as though a 10-hour day spent plowing through your inbox, or catching up on calls, was much more worthwhile than two hours spent in deep concentration on hard thinking, followed by a leisurely afternoon off. Yet any writer, designer or web developer will tell you it’s the two focused hours that pay most—both in terms of money and fulfillment

Do I keep doing whatøs always been done, or challenge old assumptions and try new approaches to problems?
Do I proactively seek new challenges or just manage those I already have?
Do I risk being exposed and vulnerable, or act to protect my pride and patch of power?
Do I ask for what I really want, or just for what I think others want to give me?
Do I øtoot my hornø to ensure others know what Iøm capable of, or just hope my efforts will be noticed?
Do I speak my mind or bite my lip, lest I ruffle feathers or subject myself to criticism?
ìYou donít get what you deserve. You get what you negotiate.î


The one line answer: youøre prioritizing øshallow work.ø Youøre making your attendance at meetings, the speed of your email replies and looking busy a proxy for real productivity. Itøs ineffective and itøs making you miserable.

Everything we do at the office gets called øwork.ø And thatøs a problem. Really, there are two kinds of work:

øDeep workø is using your skills to create something of value. It takes thought, energy, time and concentration.
øShallow workø is all the little administrative and logistical stuff: email, meetings, calls, expense reports, etc.
Shallow work stops you from getting fired ø but deep work is what gets you promoted.

Unit tests prove that your code actually works.

What is the most important thing i can do to improve tomorrow?

When I do speak with these senior leaders I ask them all the same question which is, “what is the one piece of advice you have for employees on how they should stay relevant and adapt in this rapidly changing world?” They all tell me the same thing. The number one piece of advice is “Learn how to learn.” We are starting to see things change very quickly in today’s workplace. A lot of the things we learned while in school are no longer relevant. Skills that were once coveted are now outdated. The ability for employees to learn how to learn is the number one skill being assessed today. It is not only what executives are looking for, but something the individual contributor needs to be consciously aware of as a way to future proof their careers.




2. Employee satisfaction doesn't matter

Problem is, measuring workers' satisfaction or happiness levels is just not enough to retain star performers and build a successful business. You think giving more vacation time is great? Try this on: Engaged employees who took less than one week off from work in a year had 25% higher overall well-being than actively disengaged associates -- even those who took six weeks or more of vacation time.

Employees don't want to be "satisfied" as much as they want to be engaged. What they want most is a great boss who cares about their development, and a company that focuses on and develops their strengths. Trying to satisfy employees' appetites for free lunches, lattes, and ping pong tables is giving people something they don't deeply want -- and that isn't natural or good for them. What you're doing is feeding the bears.

A winning culture is one of engagement and individual contribution to an important mission and purpose. Human beings are not looking for company-bought goodies -- they are looking for meaningful, fulfilling work. It is the new great global dream -- to have a good job, not a free lunch. The dream is to have a job in which you work for a great manager; where you constantly develop; and where you can use your God-given strengths every single day.

There's a lot more to professional programming than writing code. From working with a team to solve problems to version control, you won't make it to the major leagues without a toolkit of other critical skills.

With all the buzz about learning to code, it's easy to think that knowing a programming language is all it takes to be a professional developer. However, like other jobs, it takes more than one skill to really be great. We can't list everything that every programmer may need, but here are some of the most important skills (besides coding) you should work on if you really want to be a developer.


When implementing a specific part of the project, don’t only think about the ways it’s supposed to work, but also what it does when something unexpected happens. Does the function fail if one of the input parameters is negative, or null? What if some of the data files the program needs don’t exist, or are the wrong type or size? What happens if another thread is updating this linked list at the same time this thread is traversing it? The knowledge to check for these kinds of things comes with experience – after debugging a specific issue, you’ll know to check for that kind of issue (and similar issues) in the future.

Ever wished you could go back and talk to your younger, twentysomething self? You know, the one who was just starting out and could have used some sound career advice—or at least a bit of reassurance that you were doing the right thing?

While you can’t go back in a time, you can pay it forward. Hindsight is twenty-twenty—and some of the best insights come from past experiences.


On coding:

On learning:
 
This week marks the beginning of my 4th year at Facebook. I thought I would share some of my insights.

1. Minimize WIP work in progress.  

2. Don't overestimate your abilities. It is much better to come in with the attitude that you know nothing.

3. Your job consists of far more than just typing code into an editor. Have pride in your work and write clean code. Communication is very important. It's all about getting shit done.

While some media sources portray programming as a loner's craft, the truth is that it really involves a lot of communication and working with others. If you work for a company, you'll be part of a development team and be expected to communicate and work well with others.



Nothing in school prepared me for the amount of written communication I'd have ahead. (We just code, right?) In your professional careerøif you'd like to move up one dayøyou'll spend a ton of time communicating clearly, concisely and convincinglyøthinking from the perspective of the recipientøover email to coworkers, managers, clients/partners and hopefully one day executives. And since you're used to doing things twice as fast as others (we're crafty, right?) it's going to be frustrating, because it's going to take you twice as long to get this right. And as an independent, this skill is a make-it-or-break-itøbut by necessity you'll learn the hard way as you go.

4. Why gettings things done? In the end, what counts is money earned. Everything else is a proxy. If you want to get paid, your company needs to earn money. Honour deadlines. Getting things done means no gold plating. It means understanding the necessity for business to get features to their customers. The only thing that matters is Business value. If you want to grow and not be just coder you need to understand this term.

5. I know by myself, EVERY time when I get new project, with existing code base, first thought is frustration, and desire to rewrite it the way you feels right. And it works for all programmers without exception. Ever look back at some of your old code and grimace in pain? How stupid you were! How could you, who know so much now, have written that? Burn it! Burn it with fire!
AP: I'm at the C2MTL [conference] this week and this topic has come up a lot. My advice? Look at every challenge — no matter how large or small — as an opportunity. Every challenge is an opportunity to learn, to meet other people, and to learn something about yourself and your unique talents and skills.

BI: Anything else you think we should know?

AP: I think the single most undervalued character trait is enthusiasm. I want to work with individuals that are passionate and ready for a challenge. Be brave in taking on new challenges — whether that's a new role at work or a new job altogether. And let your enthusiasm shine through; it will inspire others around you.

What's Your Biggest Problem and How Can I Help You Solve It?

6. But to be a programmer, you need to learn how to read code. That's the hard part because it requires you to understand, maintain, fix, and extend existing products.  You will have to become very good at reading code and deciphering what other programmers intended to do. This will be frustrating and hard. You'll feel like you're not good at it, like the job is too difficult, like you could do so much better if you only rewrote everything from scratch

Many developers say that understanding a programming language is only a minor part of coding. Problem-solving is another important skill that rookie developers often lack. Compare software development to putting a puzzle together: you need to figure out how to connect one piece of your program to another, and it's not always easy. 

7. It is not what you do, it is what you sell. You can spend days making your codebase a better place, writing more robust code, and fix others' mistakes. As long as it does not have a big business impact and you can't ship it, it means practically nothing. Nobody will appreciate you for fixing styling or architectural issues in their core, in fact, they may get offended.

Year One: I'm in over my head. My semi-bluff was in-fact a bluff. They’re going to fire me any day.
Year Two: It's nice to feel like a productive team member”
Year Three: This is fun, and I'm not bad at it. It's satisfying to pass on knowledge to teammates.
Year Four: This feels repetitive, that grass over there sure looks greener”

The truth is, the programming world is one that is constantly changing. What we regard as a best practice today can be obsolete tomorrow. It's simply not possible to write perfect code because the standards upon which our code is judged is evolving every day. It's tough to cope with the fact that your work, as beautiful as it may be now, is probably going to be ridiculed later. It's frustrating because no matter how much research we do into the latest and greatest tools, designs, frameworks, and best practices, there's always the sense that what we’re truly after is slightly out of reach. For me, this is the most annoying thing about being a programmer. The fragility of what we do is necessary to facilitate improvement, but I can't help feeling like I'm one of those sand-painting monks.

It's not about the effort, it's about the outcome
The client did not care how much effort we'd put in. My attempts to highlight this were pointless. Do I care how long it takes a mechanic to fix my car? No, I just care that its fixed. By focusing on the outcome we regained traction.

8. 2. Not asking the right questions. People who are awarded for their work ask a lot of questions like: øwhy does this take so long?ø or øwhat if we couldø?ø People who go unnoticed for their work are those who keep their minds and mouths closed about how their work should or could be done.


11. 2-3 hours of coding a day is great. Figuring out code, debugging strange things, attending meetings and dealing with interruptions/helping other people.


9. Beautiful Is Pointless. Let's consider code beauty again, from the angle of business value. When facing an implementation choice, should a developer opt for solution A, which uses ugly code, or for solution B, which is beautiful? That's not the right question: from the end user's perspective, the alternative doesn't make any sense. The user won't look at the code, especially if the product is not good enough to be even tried. So the developer should choose the solution that brings the most value to the product.

The risk is that the product becomes more expensive without any real added value. Would you be willing to buy a piece of furniture twice the normal price because the craftsman uses the most expensive tools available? And what would you think of a poor craftsman who, using poor equipment, manages to create great furniture?

10. When I look at  the different jobs that exist which a person could do, I just can't see how sitting  all day hacking at code should command salaries of 100k+. It seems too easy. The world is completely unfair in this respect. For example, when I see the wait staff at a restaurant running around to serve dinner, I feel these people as working harder than any internet engineer you'll ever see.
3. Feedback isn’t automatic. In college,you generally know where you stand with your professors. You get some kind of feedback after every major paper, presentation, or exam, measured by a professor’s somewhat consistent standards.

To get an excellent rating at work is a lot harder and requires a lot more experience and effort than getting an “A” in a course at college. It involves doing more that what is expected of you on the job.

The lack of regular, ongoing, detailed feedback is another hard part of the transition. Many managers don’t take the time to critique each project or assignment. More often, they say something vague like, ”Good job,” and hand out a new one. That leaves many recent grads unsure of how they are doing.

Strategy: Ask for feedback.Appropriate times are at the completion of an assignment or before tackling a new one. For instance, you can ask your boss, “What could I have done differently during that project?” Or “What would make this an even better report?” Another possibility: ask a colleague for help, for example by saying, “I’m going to make a presentation in our department meeting. Would you please listen to it and tell me what I could do to make it better next time?”

ALWAYS FELT A LITTLE TOO LUCKY AND SOMEWHAT GUILTY

Despite the 70 hour workweeks on Wall St. and the intense stress, Iíve always felt like I didnít fully deserve to make the money I was making. Income is obscene compared to every other industry I know of. Working for a corporation almost felt like CHEATING. I didnít build any products at Goldman, nor did I do anything to establish its reputation. All I had to do was get in, not screw things up, and a six figure income was mine after the first full year of work. Iíll write a post about getting into Wall St. at a future date if interested.


recent tweet by Carl Caum of PuppetLabs:

Continuous Delivery doesnít mean every change is deployed to production ASAP. It means every change is proven to be deployable at any time

Ask for feedback. ìDonít be afraid to ask your boss for feedback,î Maroney says. ìDonít assume that your work isnít valued because your manager is juggling multiple deliverables and not spending as much time with you as youíd like.î Too many people shy away from speaking up for fear of the unknown, she adds. ìIdeally your manager should already be providing feedback but this is your career so donít be afraid to take the driverís seat.î

You must understand the problem. Deeply and completely. Who is this for? Why do they need it? How are they doing this today? What canít they live without? This is where the most amount of energy and time should be spent, yet this is where assumptions and dogma tend to trump exploration and deconstruction.

Glossing over this part of the process is dangerous. Youíll build on a foundation of assumptions. This leads to solutions that, while possibly well executed, miss the mark. In contrast, when you dig deep and break down the problem to its most essential, you can then build from bedrock. And build whatís actually necessary. All your energy is focused on improving the small set of things that actually matter. Creating the opportunity for an experience that is truly greater than the sum of its parts.


1. Why is this a project to begin with?

2. What purpose does the work serve, what is the end-goal?

3. Who needs to be involved, and who is the project ultimately for?

4. When does it need to be completed and when are the project milestones (if there arenít any, make some)?

5. Where will the work appear and where will it be worked on? P


 Ask high performers at the next level what they found challenging about the transition, what they did to prepare, and what they would do differently if they could.  Pay particular attention to how they allocate their time.

5. Always come to the table with a solution.

Offering a solution or idea is only half of the equation and many managers feel that an idea without an action plan will only create more work for them, Meador says. ìShare ideas with context and a clear path for implementation for the leader to evaluate.î The more you present any issues with recommended solutions and then implement those solutions in a timely and effective manner, the more the leadership team will rely on you and think about you for future projects and new responsibilities, she says.

7. Improve your communication skills.

10) Work on your communications skills. It doesnít matter how smart you are if you communicate like Golem from Lord Of The Rings. The people who get the farthest are those who are able to make people feel at ease. Part of making people feel at ease is having a knowledge bank so deep that you are able to relate to anything the other party is talking about. Develop your understanding of politics, sports, finance, and trash magazine issues. Learn to speak another language well and travel abroad to understand new cultures. Be a voracious reader. Join ToastMasters. Get into the habit of writing proposals every day. Having good written and oral communication skills will get you farther than any genius brain will.

One of the most common mistakes made by both managers and employees today, is that too often, both are afraid to come to the table and talk about underlying issues, Taylor says. ìFear of confrontation is so overwhelming, but if you communicate boldly, more frequently, and honestly in 2014, and youíre not afraid to work through conflict, youíll likely reduce your stress and be a better worker.î Too much time is spent dwelling on misunderstood employee communications, which, if left unaddressed, eventually leads to conflict. ìAnd an ever-tempting, over-reliance on technology with its benefits of brevity and immediacy can exacerbate that.î

 In my work, I’ve been fortunate to learn from amazingly successful, impactful professionals and entrepreneurs. I’m defining “success” here as achieving what matters most to you, individually and authentically – not as some objective measure of outer wealth, accomplishment or achievement. Observing people in action who are living fully on their terms and absolutely loving it, I’ve seen how they think, react, interrelate, problem solve, and lead. I’ve applied these lessons to my own life, and to those I coach.
I’ve noted that people who love what they do for a living and have created tremendous success and reward, not only engage continuously in life-supporting behaviors, but also avoid certain negative actions and mindsets that other, less successful people habitually get lost in.


http://www.recruiter.com/i/micromanagers-6-reasons-your-employees-dont-like-you/
Recruiter.comøs Shala Marks warns, øpeople donøt quit jobs, they quit managers.ø

Early into my career, I left a good job with a global consulting firm because I had a lousy boss and a toxic work environment. Upon leaving, the HR lead ø a senior partner at this organization ø asked to meet with me to find out why I was leaving. I shared how undervalued I had felt, how the promises made to me upon employment had not been met and how little accountability there was for my colleagues. He was surprised and disturbed and asked if there was anything he could do to make me change my mind. Apparently Iød been ear-marked a hi-po (which would have been nice to have known before then!), but by this point it was too late. Iød already made other plans, hoping for a better work environment, and a better boss.

The lesson for me was this: have the courage to speak up rather than cower in silence for fear of an awkward conversation. The truth is that Iød been too cowardly to address my concerns with my boss or to go around her. Admittedly I was young (mid-twenties) and inexperienced, but if I knew then what I do now, it would have been that I owed it to myself, and to my boss at the time, to have at least voiced my concerns, offered up some possible solutions and engaged in a conversation about how we could have improved the situation. It may not have changed a thing, but at least I could have known that I at least gave her a chance.

So just because it may be easier to say nothing, to just øsuffer quietlyø or complain loudly to colleagues or to head for the exit as I ultimately did, you at least owe your boss the opportunity to respond. Donøt prejudge and assume they arenøt able to take feedback, or donøt care how miserable you are. When you approach them with respect and with a genuine desire to make things work better, you can open the door to whole new levels of trust, collaboration and outcomes. A door that will remain permanently closed otherwise.

Work. Hard. Smart: Give whatever you do 110%+ effort. Donøt hold back. Donøt øcoast.ø Ever. Every day you are at work, bring your creativity, your enthusiasm, your knowledge, your skills, and a team mentality to the table for your peers, your management, and your company.
Be Mindful of Your Attitude: Be positive. Be humble. Be confident (aka, believe in yourself). Attitudes can derail a career as surely as major missteps will.
Embrace Change: Donøt be afraid to take risks ø however you define them. Donøt be frozen in place and fearful of giving up the øsame old-same oldø approach in favor of the øpromising yet untested and untriedø.


“Research finds that most people approach their work in one of three ways: as a job, a career, or a calling. If you see your work as a job, you do it only for the money, you look at the clock frequently while dreaming about the weekend ahead, and you probably pursue hobbies…

“If you see your work as a career, you have larger goals of advancement, promotion, and prestige. The pursuit of these goals often energizes you, and you sometimes take work home with you because you want to get the job done properly. Yet, at times, you wonder why you work so hard. You might occasionally see your work as a rat race where people are competing for the sake of competing.

“If you see your work as a calling, however, you find your work intrinsically fulfilling—you are not doing it to achieve something else. You see your work as contributing to the greater good or as playing a role in some larger enterprise the worth of which seems obvious to you. You have frequent experiences of flow during the work day, and you neither look forward to “quitting time” nor feel the desire to shout, ‘Thank God it’s Friday!’ You would continue to work, perhaps even without pay, if you suddenly became very wealthy.”

Your career is YOUR responsibility. That’s right, YOUR responsibility. Not your manager’s responsibility. Not HR’s responsibility. And certainly not your college’s responsibility (or your parent’s). Being successful means you need to treat your career like a business and treat yourself like a product that you work on improving, year after year. Define your career aspirations and then create a career development plan that you update on an annual basis.

You can’t do mediocre work – your work must be exemplary. Doing so-so work won’t get you noticed. If you want to stand out and get promoted, then you need to do outstanding work that will get you seen by management. Look for ways you can go above and beyond the daily requirements to demonstrate how you add value to the organization.

Don’t let a rotten economy spoil your goals. Use the career and money advice in The Millennial Game Plan to get and stay ahead for good.
You need to become an expert in something. People turn to the experts when there are challenges and to solve problems. Look for areas in your business where you can put your skills to use and become an expert. Then, volunteer for projects that will allow you to use these skills and show them off.

You’ll never love 100% of your job – and that’s okay. Many young people finish high school or college and wrongly assume that they’ll love every aspect of every job they’ll ever have. The truth is… that isn’t going to happen. Literally no one loves every part of his or her job. That’s okay. The trick is to figure out the parts you love and the parts that you don’t like that much, and then come up with ways you can make the icky parts more fun.

You must continuously prove that you are an asset to the organization. So you did a great job finishing a project on time and under budget. Good for you. Now, you have to do it all over again. Don’t expect to skate by on good past performance. Every day when you get up and go into work, you must be able to prove your value to the company.




TIPS:

2. They attack the disease, not the symptoms.

So much company time goes to firefighting on a reactive basis. Employees create value when they assess the root cause of the problems and make systemic change that eliminates the problems completely.


8. They act with the big picture in mind.

People who only work in their own isolation often cause challenges for those in other parts of the company. Employees create value when they work to comprehend how their efforts impact the whole so they can adjust accordingly.


The problem is that most of us donít have time for all that. But hereís the secret: you can make time. Schedule for it. Typically, I block out an hour a day, preferably late in the afternoon. No meetings, no phone calls. That way, when something comes up, I have an hour of flexibility to address it. Even if the task takes more time than that, my schedule doesnít get so jammed up that I miss many meetings and leave people hanging with an empty phone in their hands.


 I love the craft and challenge of designing and writing software. Language details don't mattter - paradigms shift every 5-10 years anyhow.

the bull is dead


Most impatient seeming bosses arenøt suffering from some chronic character flaw. More often than not, they just have a particular communication style that likes things at a high level, without too much detail, and a focus on cutting-to-the-chase. And for the record, that describes a lot of bosses. C-level executives, and especially CEOs, are often wired this way.

Not everybody likes to give and get information in the same way. A lot of bosses, and especially those that seem impatient, are Intuitive communicators that want non-linear communications. That means being short and to the point and without much emotion. If you give this boss the bottom line, big picture view first to gain their buy-in, youøve got a good shot at winning them over to hearing your other points. But if youøre someone who naturally gravitates towards process-driven, detailed communication (what I call Functional communicators), and you give this boss point a, then point b, then point c, slowly and incrementally building to point z, you are absolutely going to make their head explode.


So, instead of saying øI canøt tell you that it will ruin the movieø and then trying to persuade the boss to go to the movie (or approve your new project, idea, proposal, etc.) with a pile of details about the outstanding box office returns, the Academy Award nominations, the great acting, costumes and sets and all the rest, why not just give the boss the big picture information she wants. Tell her how the movie ends: øThe boat sinks and Leo dies.ø Itøs really that easy.

This isnøt about what youød want to know or how youød like to have it communicated to you. Itøs about what the boss wants to know and how the boss wants it communicated. Intuitive communicators really want to know how the movie ends. That big picture endpoint is what tells them whether or not they want to invest their time in watching the movie, or listening to your proposal, or idea or whatever.

They wish they had expressed their feelings.

Weíre taught as children that emotions are dangerous and that they must be bottled up and controlled. This usually works at first, but boxing up your feelings causes them to grow until they erupt. The best thing you can do is to put your feelings directly on the table. Though itís painful to initiate, it forces you to be honest and transparent.

For example, if you feel as though you donít make enough money at work, schedule a meeting with your boss and propose why you think youíre worth more. As a result, she will either agree with you and give you a raise or disagree and tell you what you do need to do to become more valuable. On the other hand, if you do nothing and let your feelings fester, this will hinder your performance and prevent you from reaching your goal.



Halting the Proliferation of Tools
TNS: But how do you stop the proliferation of tools?

JA:  One of the things that weøve done for a number of years is to recognize that if youøre going to solve a problem, and you think you need to solve it in a new and novel way that canøt be solved with the technology stack or the patterns that we already have ø then thatøs fine, itøs just that we need to be explicit about the operational costs of doing so. Introducing something new and different can bear a huge long-term cost to the organization.

TNS:  So itøs not just the case of it being free, itøs also the case of youøve got to support it, and then other people have to learn bits of itø

JA:  So we do something called øarchitecture reviews.ø Iøm a developer; Iøm working on this tdumbo_office_063hing; Iøve run into a problem; and Iøve tried the various ways that we typically have tried to solve similar problems; and if those donøt work sufficiently, what I want to do is I want to ask the greater population of engineers at the company, øHey, Iøm working on this problem. I think the only way to solve it is by using this brand-new thing that nobody knows about. Please talk me out of this.ø

I want somebody to raise their hand and say øAfter youøve described this problem, I know exactly what youøre doing because check this out ø six months ago, I had a very similar thing and I finally figured it out. You could just use the thing that Iøve got!ø

Thereøs no reason to re-invent the wheel.

I know: you spend your whole day thinking.

But actually you donøt. You spend your whole day reacting to issues, to requests, to targets and goals and hurdlesø reacting is thinking, but itøs a very different type of thinking. What you donøt get to do is think strategically: about your future, about how best to reach your goals, about how to better work with the people around youø that kind of thinking is incredibly productive. In my experience, the difference in successful and unsuccessful people is partly based on the fact that successful people set aside time to just think.

Every engineer I interviewed stressed hard how splitting your code changes into logical modules made it easier for other people to understand and accept quickly. By reducing the cognitive load of the diffs they sent out, reviewers were more confident in accepting changes. Also, by reducing the size of the diffs, the changes were less intimidating for reviewers to look at, so the throughput was faster.



1. Be fearless in diving into code you donít know.

Jumping into an unfamiliar codebase can be uncomfortable and scary ó many people give up without even trying. This critical skill gets easier as you do it more often, and in the process, you become a significantly better programmer. If an open-source library or a library from another team doesnít work as you expect, it gives you the flexibility of jumping into the source code to debug why.

2. Master debugging.

ìWhy isnít my code doing what I expect?î Thatís a question we ask ourselves every day as software engineers. The ability to debug effectively has a disproportionately large impact on an engineerís ability to get things done, and yet tends to be under-taught in college and under-evaluated in technical interviews.

How do you debug effectively? At its core, it distills down to the scientific method:

Make a guess about whatís going on.
Assuming the guess were true, identify what the consequences of that guess would be.
Try to make observations that contradict those consequences.
If you find a contradiction, your guess is incorrect, so make another one. If not, you have one possible explanation.
To get faster at debugging then, you have to learn to make better guesses, and you have to get proficient at tools and techniques that help you make better observations.

Making better guesses comes with practice as you solve more problems.

3. Invest in time-saving tools.

On the other hand, weíre still all limited by the same 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. This means that any manual work we can offload onto computers is extremely high-leverage. We do that by investing in time-saving tools and automating workflows. Tools let us amplify the output we create with the time we spend. Automation enables things to get done in our sleep or while weíre focused on other problems.

As I was writing The Effective Engineer, I sat down with Bobby Johnson, a former engineering director at Facebook who grew the infrastructure team from 6 people to over 100. One of his observations thatís stuck with me is that ìof people who were successful, almost all of them write a lot of tools.î

4. Optimize your iteration speed.

Say it takes you 12 seconds to search and navigate from a function call to where itís defined. And suppose you have to do similar navigations 60 times per day. Thatís 12 minutes per day spent navigating files. If you learn enough keyboard shortcuts in your text editor to navigate to a file in 2 seconds instead of 12, then over the course of a day, youíd save 10 minutes. Every year, youíd save an entire 40-hour work week.

Find 3 more similar optimizations, and youíd save a month. Imagine what you could do with an extra month per year.

Or suppose that youíre fixing a bug that requires you to start the app and then navigate through five screens to set up the right conditions to trigger the bug. Could you spend 10 minutes to wire it up so that it goes to the buggy screen on startup? Youíd be able to iterate significantly faster on that bug with a small initial investment.

Systematically ask yourself, ìHow can I iterate faster?î The payoffs will be enormous and compound over time.




FAIL FAST, ITERATE

øI try to turn around code fast when possible even if Iøm not sure itøs optimal (to get comments) and prefer failing fast trying ideas over thinking through 100%øøøøAri Chivukula
øIøm not intimidated by code and I can get in the zone easily and crush through stufføøøøMichael Novati
One thing that will probably hold back a lot of engineers (myself included) is fear of failure. Trying to create the perfect product off the bat can be intimidating and cause us to overthink problems. Getting into a habit of jumping into code without knowing exactly how it will turn out can allow us to iterate much faster and see results.


Producing well-written code is one of the hardest aspects of programming, and I continue to struggle with it. There is always room for improvement and techniques to work on. Like when writing something new, a new program or feature starts out as a rough outline. It gets filled in until it works functionally, but the first time it works it may be a few long, wordy functions with no organization. Through a process of editing and hard thinking, the program takes on a more structured shape that lays out the thought process more clearly. Some parts of the program may require deep consideration, and the best layout and flow are not apparent at first. It may need to be revisited multiple times before all of the ideas are expressed clearly. After enough refinement, the program begins to look like the well-organized collection of ideas that makes for an easily maintainable and clearly understandable code base.

Like writing, you can improve on programming your entire life. There is always something to work on, some way to make your code more clear and understandable, and a better way to express your ideas.


Ultimately, programming is like writing. You're trying to find the best way to express ideas clearly and succinctly. If you can do it in an engaging way, all the better. 

 The compiler or interpreter doesn't care one whit about formatting or naming or style.

 My perspective on programming has changed quite a bit over the years. Even in the few years since I started this blog I've noticed that I look at programming differently than I used to. 


 As many career counselors advise, the best time to polish up your resume is when you already have a job

øWhat does my boss do that makes my job easier?ø

On the positive, what does your boss do that makes your work more fulfilling? How does he or she energize you at work? Do you get opportunities to go to new or advanced training classes? Does he or she consider you for new assignments, new challenges, or more delegated tasks that grow your job duties and expand your current scope of work? Does he or she run interference for you with senior management or customers and clients to protect you when youøve done the right thing? Do you get praise in public and feedback in private? Does he or she catch you doing good things and give you coaching when you need a course correction?



Do you find keeping up with technology/languages/frameworks difficult?
Well, I donøt think anybody could (or would want to try) to keep up with ALL the new technologies/langauges/frameworks, or even the majority of the popular ones. I remember, for example, when Perl started to become popular. Once it had gotten a certain critical mass, I had heard about it so many times, I filed it in the back of my mind as a to-learn technology. That was over 20 years ago, and I havenøt really gotten around to learning it yetø thereøs so much out there, and you only have so much time, you have to manage your time wisely. 


Never say it can't be done. Anything can be done. It just costs. convey the costs.
Never say 'I don't know'. Especially to yourself. You saw unexpected behavior? Try to find the root cause.
Always try to find the root cause.


9. Writing Clear Code, Not Clever Code

One of my passions as a programmer is figuring out new and better ways to do the same thing. I love refactoring code and finding out what was being done in 10 lines, I could do in 3. Or as a better measure, doing something with one if else block instead of a triply nested if else statement. Usually this works out great. The code is simpler to maintain, and less complex for all involved.
However, in my endless pursuit of smaller, clearer code, I would often end up with smaller, more confusing code. In 2009, as a member of a 7 person agile team, it was very easy to measure how I was doing in this category: How often did another team member ask me what a piece of code did? Once I began looking at these problematic blocks of code, I noticed a pattern, and began to work on resolving the problem. It doesnít matter what my particular problem wasÖ what mattered was that I began looking for it!

I always try to write defensive code

After 10 years of coding, I have serious trust issues. The code I write never trusts anything or anyone any more.

The thing is that different developers have different experiences, personal styles and even mind sets. Based on personal experience, one simple function can be interpreted in two totally different ways depending on the developers and their own past experience and each developer thinks their interpretation is the clear obvious one.

That's why I always often code practice defensive programming. With other words, I always make sure that methods and functions I write will be called as I intended them to be called, for example by adding assertions in the beginning of the function body. Regardless if its a private of a public function, and especially if I am coding in loosely typed languages or functions with optional arguments.
