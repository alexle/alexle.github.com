Most people let how they “feel” dictate the course of their lives.

If they feel tired, they sleep in. If they feel uninspired, they don’t create. If they don’t feel like doing something, they usually won’t.

If you only ever do what you feel like doing…you won’t do much in your life.

You need to cultivate a healthy “no-matter-what” mantra in your daily routine. No matter what — you’ll do it. Even if you don’t feel like it.

This is always a characteristic in the world’s most successful people.



Is there something your partner has expressed a desire to do? Such as: lose weight, write an article, go back to school, or learn to ski? Why not encourage their dream? Many dreams are killed by a spouse or friend who says, "It's not realistic." "We can't afford it." "You won't follow through." Don't be a dream-killer. Learn to speak encouraging words such as: "I know you can do it because you are an excellent writer." "If you want to go back to school, we'll find the money." "If you decide to go on a diet, I'll be happy to join you." One encouraging statement can be the difference between success and failure. Remember, we give life or death to people's dreams by what we say.





1. “I’m Happy Enough Where I Am”

I hear people use the phrase “good enough” all the time. And usually, it’s when they’re trying to justify a less-than-perfect situation, or talk themselves out of aiming higher.

Think about it—have you ever used the phrase “happy enough” when you were actually happy?

People say this when they have a dream on the back burner that they’re trying to ignore.

“Happy enough” is an excuse that works—temporarily. But, it usually means that something bigger is brewing.

Move Past It

It’s true: In the short term, it’s probably easier to keep climbing the ladder in your current industry, than to learn new skills or even take a pay cut to make a career change.

But, think ahead to five years from now. Are you still happy—enough (or even at all)—in your current sector, or are you totally burned out? What if you switched fields? Would you love your job?

Once you see staying where you are as a Band-Aid (and not a permanent solution), making the change is less of a risk.



There are no shortcuts to any place worth going.

Deep down you know this is true.

You have to do hard things to be happy in life.  The things most people are avoiding.  The things that frighten you and make you uncomfortable.  The things others can’t do for you.  The things that make you question how much longer you can hold on and push forward.

Why?

Because those are the things that ultimately define you.  Those are the things that make the difference between existing and living – between knowing the path and walking the path – between a life of mediocrity and a life filled with progress and fulfillment. there are no short cuts .. it is not the type of activity you can finesse your way to success .. to get better, you have to put in the work





You see, we were told to never settle. We were told to reach for the stars and then build a rocket to get there. We were told that the weak settle for content lives instead of striving for happy ones. We were told to look for the best and only accept the answer once we know it is the best. We were taught these things by the older generations who now call us crazy for believing those things.




We explore. We travel. We grow. We meet new people. We are creating families out of connections that have nothing to do with blood. We look at the white picket fence homes that we are supposed to settle down into and only see limitations.

For us, settling down is the same thing as settling for a mediocre life.
There is a whole world to explore still. There are empires to create. There are dreams to achieve. There are places to go, people to see, and memories to be made. And buying a two-story house in the suburbs of the small town, USA would only get in the way of all of that. We’ve discovered that you don’t need a house to be at home. We value experiences and connect rather than material investments such as huge houses.

This doesn’t mean we aren’t out there getting married or starting families, it just means they don’t look the way our parent’s families did. We are having kids and traveling with them. We are marrying who we want, when we want, and then seeing the world with them. We are doing the jobs we want to do, where we want to do them. We are still creating life it just doesn’t look the way they are used to.

We understand that life isn’t meant to be lived in one place anymore. We live in such a globalized world now. We travel as far as we can for as long as we can and then just maybe we consider staying put.

Maybe that makes us a crazy generation. Maybe this makes us unstable. Or maybe it just means we are squeezing every drop out of this life we were given and doing it in the way we want to. Maybe we understand that change isn’t a bad thing and that life is going to shift with or without us. Things are going to constantly change no matter what we do so why not change things ourselves?




Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld explain that most successful people not only control their impulses, but also have an implicit sense of inferiority.

These people may have confidence, yet, they remain unsure of themselves. They have a chip on their shoulder due to being oppressed in some way. So they continuously push themselves, regardless of how successful they become, to prove themselves. They are never satisfied with what they’ve done. They continue to feel inferior.

These very traits are awarded in today’s economy because they are so rare. Again, few people control their impulses, but instead live for the moment. And few people, especially in America, have any sense of inferiority. Rather, most people have bought into the myth that you must first love yourself before you can become successful.

If You Don’t Like It, Change It

People love to complain. It’s like a rite of passage in the workplace. It doesn’t matter what job, I don’t know a single person that doesn’t do it. And I get it, people feel stuck. But you have more control than you think. I was listening to a panel the other day, when someone said “Your career is your choice: if you don’t like it, change it.” Realize if you don’t change it, you have made that decision. Now, there’s a novel idea. People often counter that it’s much harder than that. You can’t just change things. The reality is you are the only one that can. More often than not You have much more control over it than you think. We’re so preoccupied with not wanting to make a mistake and worried about not getting it right that we end up making no decision or move at all.
