3 Questions To Ask Yourself Everyday
12-30-2014




1. "Where am I?"

Taking the time to ask yourself where you currently are in life is incredibly important. A huge majority of the population never even stops to analyze where they are right this moment and if that's where they truly want to be. They just continue going through the motions and living life way beneath their full potential.

Then, all of a sudden, they get stopped dead in their tracks and realize how their unfulfilling lives are, and enter into a state of feeling sorry for themselves and playing the blame game. Please don’t fall into that trap. Start asking yourself on a continual basis where you currently are in life and answer that question honestly. One of the hardest things to do is to admit that you aren’t where you want to be or that you have been doing it all wrong leading up to this point.

However, do you know what’s even much harder to deal with? Regret. And a lot of the regret that people unfortunately experience comes directly from never taking the time to ask this simple but extremely important question.

2. "Where do I want to be?"

This question is all about digging deep within yourself and discovering what your true passions, goals and dreams really are. In this day and age, it is so easy to get sidetracked by the fast-paced and noisy world we live in, while totally forgetting about what we truly want for our lives, personally and professionally.

One of the best ways to constantly make sure that you are moving in the right direction is to get in the habit of asking yourself where exactly you want to be. Where do you want to be professionally? Where do you want to be financially? Where do you want to be in your personal relationships? Where do you want to be in your health journey?

3. "How am I going to get there?"

All three of these questions are vitally important to ask yourself, but this last question can exponentially change the game for you. This question also happens to be the one that most people end up never asking because it requires a whole lot of work and actually getting up and doing something after you take the time to answer it.

Everything that I have ever been able to accomplish in my life has been a direct result of constantly asking myself this particular question, writing down every possible thing I can think of, and then taking massive action to execute everything that I wrote down.

Asking the above three questions and taking the time to write out the answers on a regular basis has changed my life in so many ways; and I fully believe it can do the same for you. I don’t just challenge you to ask yourself these questions, but to actually think long and hard about your answers and then write them out.




For many of us, our mornings are a blur of

For many of us, the morning is a time for reflection. It's a time to meditate on what's been going on over the past few days, what you're going to do throughout the workday, and where you're going in the future. It's easy to go through the motions of the daily routine and miss those key opportunities for self-examination, but if you don't take the time to ask yourself critical questions about your career, you could end up continuing in a bad direction or get stuck in a rut.

Finding the right questions to ask is also tough, but I�ve found that these five can help you evaluate exactly where you are, exactly where you want to go, and how you�re going to get there:

Let's face it. We spend the majority of our days going through the same motions.

Wake up. Sit in traffic. Spend 8-9 hours at work. Rush home for dinner with family. Watch some tv then head to bed.

Take some time to evaluate what things are most important to you: what do you want to change, where do you want to go, what would you like to be different a year from now? You can even put visualization techniques to work by taking a few slow, deep breaths and visualizing a specific goal in as much detail as possible. The more clearly you can see your goal, the more inspired you will be.

In the lives of busy people, we sometimes forget what's important. These six questions will help you gain focus and productivity.

Let me guess...

You often drag yourself to work and feel like everyday is the same.

Perhaps it feels like your life is on autopilot.

At moments you might even feel like your life is not very meaningful and you miss a clear sense of purpose.

At the end of the day, what you�re really looking for is to live a meaningful and purposeful life�a life that matters.

You�re worried that you�re going about your life the wrong way and that by the time you�re 50 or 60, you�ll have nothing but a deep sense of regret and unfulfilment.

It makes sense though. Because the truth is, we only get to live once.

So what makes a meaningful life and a life that matters?

 is key to making sure you�re on track to achieving what it is you want.


This doesn�t need to be an hour�think 10 minutes. It�ll bring  add a productive start to your day.

keep my priorities straight in times like this with 6 simple questions that keep everything on track, including my sanity.


###1. Why Am I Doing This?###

Does it take you closer to your goals? Do my actions have impact on company revenue?

�Why was my project important to the company, you ask? You got me. I have no idea. My VP wanted it done, that�s all I know.�

###2. What Am I Thankful For###
Whom Should I thank
I am constantly aware and appreciative of the dedicated and talented people around me who do great work and contribute to our overall success. But when things are going fast, I sometimes forget to tell them how much I am grateful for their contribution. It doesn't matter if they are people directly on my team or outsiders who stepped up to contribute. I must prioritize making them feel appreciated for their efforts. They deserve the thanks and acknowledgment more than I deserved the support.

Makes you happier
Improve mindset

simply by changing my mindset. If you constantly think about bad things in your life, like your annoying coworker or a recent mistake, then she/he/it will take up a disproportionate amount of your mental space. On the other hand, if you focus instead on your recent successes, your new goals and your fun coworkers, not only will your days be more pleasant and the irritating coworker or temporary defeat fade to the background, but the positive things in your life will grow and flourish.

Having a mind filled with negative thoughts will lead to a negative life, and a mind filled with positivity will breed a positive one.

tification is a drag. To stave off spontaneous purchases not aligned with your goals, put visual reminders of what you�re saving for in places where you�ll see them: a photo of Patagonia on your desk, a shot of your dream house on your fridge, the logo of your new venture inside your wallet. Whatever you�re dreaming of, get an irresistible image of it, and put it in places you frequently see so you don�t forget the reason for all these budget rules.

3. Express gratitude � daily.

5. Write down why you are grateful
Feeling and thinking about the things you are grateful for as you wake up is a great way to build more happiness.

Research on our brain shows that we always tend to focus on the negative things of life like those worries, tragedies, failures, and discontent. Negativity is the default position.

�We�ve got this negativity bias that�s a kind of bug in the stone-age brain in the 21st century,� � Rick Hanson, neuropsychologist.

This is why we need to focus on the good and more especially, we need to hone in on what we should be grateful for.

Grateful people are happier, less depressed, less stressed, and more satisfied with their relationships and their overall lives. Grateful people have a higher sense of purpose in life, better coping skills, stronger circles of support, and less trouble sleeping.

How should I start tomorrow?
little forward planning can ease your mind and allow you to set up structures that may make tomorrow even more productive

###3. How Can I Be More Efficient?###


I'm a big believer in self-reflection, and I'm all about finding ways to make things (including myself!) better whenever possible. The reality is, none of us are perfect. Whether it's for work or personal development, there's always opportunity for growth. And the question for most people isn't if they can do something to improve, but how.

Both research and trial and error suggest that one of the best ways to make something more effective is to measure it. So, why not apply this to your own life? A simple tactic that I've recently adopted is creating my own personal feedback system.


At the end of the day, week, meeting, event, you-name-it, rate how you think it went on a scale of one to 10.
If it wasn’t a 10, ask yourself: "What would have made it a 10?"

Putting a number on an intangible experience suddenly makes what was amazing or not so amazing about it a lot more clear. When you acknowledge that things didn't go perfectly, you accept the fact that there's room for improvement, and more importantly, what that improvement might look like. It's an insanely easy way to gain clarity, and the approach shines a bright light on exactly what you can do differently next time.

In Action

Think back to your last team discussion. If you'd score your performance an eight out of 10, what could have made it a 10? Talking a tiny bit less and listening more to the great ideas being shared? Or maybe not being afraid to speak up when you had a really great idea? Keep that in mind next time.

If you're new at sales, perhaps your most recent pitch was a six. So what would a solid 10 look like? Starting off a little less aggressively in the beginning and instead asking more questions to get a better sense of your customer's needs? You can bet that'll happen in your next pitch.

Perhaps you met a few interesting people at that networking event last week--good but not great, a seven. What would have made your time more worthwhile? Making your way around the room more instead of spending so much time with that one person you already knew? There you go.

This doesn't only apply to professional improvement--take a moment to zoom out and think back to the last year. Taken as a whole, how does it stack up, and how could it have been better? A five or an eight, you'll know what made it so. Whether it’s spending more time with family or setting personal goals earlier, adjusting your priorities for the year ahead is so much easier.

On the flip side, if any experience did deserve a perfect 10 (be honest!), then you've got all the more reason to pat yourself on the back. You did your best, and it couldn’t have gone any better--congratulations!

Consistently ranking my own performance on this scale has been the most effective and powerful way I've found to fine-tune any areas of improvement. Best of all, rating yourself and facing imperfections is much less intimidating than having someone else do it for you. As long as you know what getting better looks like and make an active effort towards it, you'll be golden.

Take your victory lap. Make a habit of celebrating each small accomplishment. Make a habit of acknowledging and celebrating what you have achieved with every small success�simply because in an age where we all have to-do lists that will outlive us, there won�t be a time when �everything� is done.
