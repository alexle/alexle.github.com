On a deeper level, we all realize we have limited time. You and I both know that we’re not getting younger.

Time is ticking. It stops for no one. We need to use it. Etcetera, etcetera—we get the idea. And yet, without a clear productivity strategy, we squander our time like we have a limitless supply.

We watch endless hours of mind-numbing TV shows and movies. We spend too much time on social media looking at the lives of people we don’t give a shit about.

And when our lives and careers do not progress, we complain: “Why does my life suck and feel empty?” Because you’re wasting your damn time! That’s why!

It’s time to say “No” to wasting time on useless things that do not bring you anything but short-term pleasure. It’s time to say “Yes” to a life of productivity that will bring you a better health, wealth, and more inner satisfaction.

Don't try to do more
 do three important things a day
 Eliminate distractions
 
 Regret is a terrible thing.

Don’t wait to do the things you love. Because you never know when your time will be up.

Create that project

Whatever project you want to create, create it now.

The part of you that wants to create it right now will not be around forever.

The book you write at 25 will be very different than the book you write at 30, and 35, and 40, and so on.

As we change, our perspectives and feelings change as well.

Create what you want to create right now, and capture this moment in time.
