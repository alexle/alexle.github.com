Why Wait For A Vacation To Enjoy Your Coffee

Or, if you have an undying case of wanderlust like I do but spend more time at home wishing you were traveling, take a moment to savor the good things that come from being at home. You have time to build strong relationships, which can often be more fulfilling than a trip to some exotic locale. Plan exciting trips, sure, but don’t belittle your much-needed down time.




Every single win could be your last, so appreciate it and celebrate it and make it the best Goddamn memory you have, that way it’ll keep you warm if you’re out in the cold.



“Instead of wondering when your next vacation is, maybe you should set up a life you don’t need to escape from.” ~Seth Godin

I decided to stay to explore those feelings so I could understand what made me feel so alive when I was away and so suffocated when I was at home.

I wanted to discover what away has that home doesn’t—apart from the beautiful vistas, constant change, and sunshine—and if there was any way I could incorporate the feelings of being away when I was back at home.


Do what you have to do, but leave space too.  Be flexible.  Don’t overbook your life with rigid plans.  Sometimes great moments happen unplanned and big regrets happen by not reaching exactly what was planne

Here’s what I found.

Be More Mindful in Your Daily Life

I was sitting in a dark, dank Northern Line tube carriage on my daily forty-five-minute commute into central London when I decided, for a change, to look up from my headphone-induced daydream and be totally present in that moment.

I started to hear the sounds of the carriage slicing its way through the underground maze. I studied (in a non creepy way) the sullen faces of my fellow commuters, who appeared lost in their own daydream, when it struck me:

When I’m away, I am always fully present in every experience, no matter how mundane or challenging. 

When I am trying to be a ‘real life’ participant, I lose that focus and attention to detail, often forgetting completely to be present.

Instead, I carry out daily experiences almost on autopilot—head down, headphones in, coffee slurped in a rush, lunch eaten at my desk in between an ever growing inbox of emails.

If I were away—sitting in a café in New Zealand, on a bus in Costa Rica, or on a beach in Mexico—my eyes would be pealed studying every color, creature, person, or thing; my ears would be pricked to the sounds of chattering or wildlife; I’d taste every sip of each thirst-quenching drink or bite of a spicy meal; I’d pay attention to the smell of burning car fumes, or tropical trees. I invite magical experiences and synchronicity into each day.

Be fully present in every moment, no matter how mundane. Be nowhere else but where you are and notice how your mindset changes.


Kill Your TV

Seriously. Put it on eBay and buy yourself a gig ticket or a ton of new books. When you’re traveling or on holiday when do you ever watch TV? The occasional film or show, sure. But you likely wouldn’t spend your evenings or weekends sitting in front of a box, starting at it.

Okay, so maybe don’t get rid of your TV all together, but you could cut down on how much TV you watch. I hear so many people say, “I haven’t got time to… go to yoga, read, cook, learn something new, draw, play an instrument, be creative, meditate…” yet they can tell you who’s in Celebrity Big Brother, who’s been voted out of The X Factor, or how many times they’ve seen the same episode of Dinner Date.

Don’t deny yourself your favorite show if it brings you joy, but keep it in a healthy balance with other activities you enjoy when you’re away. Read, go exploring, meditate, go for a walk, go see a local band play. Stay active, stay curious.

And probably most importantly, try not to see “home” and “away” as two separate lives.

Your adventuring isn’t running away; it is a rich life experience. Similarly, don’t see being home as set rules of shoulds or musts to be followed.

There is a beautiful sweet spot in between the two, that with some time and exploration, you can find.




Apply the “Comfort Principle” to Your Clothing

The comfort principle is simple: spend your money where you spend most of your time. That’s why it’s a good idea to splurge on a nice mattress, comfortable desk chair, or a decent laptop computer, considering how many hours a day you sleep, work at your desk, or use that computer. Think about it, most of us wear our clothes all day long (and sometimes through the night). We wear them at work, at home, at the gym: every occasion calls for some type of clothing. It makes sense to buy clothes that earn you the most happiness out of your time, and stand up to regular use. You want work clothes that look good in the office and are comfortable. You want gym clothes that fit well and stand up to your workouts. Because you wear your clothing every day, it can be considered an experiential purchase, which is one of the ways research suggests you can actually “buy” happiness.

Clothing isn’t an investment in the traditional sense (it never gains value, and you’ll never sell an item of clothing for more than it was purchased), but it’s good to think of it like a down payment on your daily comfort, your confidence in your appearance, and the utility of your wardrobe. For example, having a couple pairs of really nice jeans that fit well, make you look good, and last forever is better than having six pairs of jeans that look “okay”, are just kind of comfy, and fall apart after a year. In the same vein, spending $100 on a single high-fashion t-shirt is a bit much, but there’s nothing wrong with spending $40 on a three-pack of nice t-shirts you know you’ll be excited to wear every day. You spend a lot of time in your clothes, so why not spring for nice items you know you’ll wear all the time?
