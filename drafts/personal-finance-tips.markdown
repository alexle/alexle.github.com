Everyone wants to learn tips and tricks for getting rich while exerting as little effort as possible. How can we save for a house, retirement, pay off debt and live without sacrificing any of life’s luxuries while working at a job we love? 

Plenty of places offer these solutions, too. Invest your money in this, take this job, buy some virtual coins that you can’t spend anywhere. It’s all so exciting!

But if you want to save and invest effectively to put yourself in the best position possible, you likely already know the best ways to do that. And for 99.99999% of people, day trading cryptocurrency is not one of them.

Do you want to know the secret? It’s pretty simple: There is no single, exciting trick out there that will suddenly make you a master with your money. The truth is your finances should be boring.






One of the easiest personal finance tips out there is to simply stop wanting more stuff. It’s simple, but it’s true–if you had an easy way to basically eliminate your desire to acquire anything new aside from things to cover your barest needs, personal finance would become incredibly easy. Sadly, humans don’t work that way.

Our desires run amok for a lot of reasons. We want things for personal enjoyment. We want them because they’ll fill an emotional hole in our life. We want them to impress others or to keep up with the Joneses. We want to feel rewarded for the hard work we put into our lives.

All of those things–and many more–wind up being justifications for the non-necessities that we spend our money on.

But here’s the problem: everything has an opportunity cost.

When you spend money on something, you’re taking away every other thing you could have done with that money.

When you spend time on something, you’re taking away every other thing you could have done with that time.

The reality of life is that you can have some things, but you can’t have everything. Whenever you have something, that means you’re choosing not to have something else. I could have all of the material items I listed above, but I’d quickly wreck all of our plans for the future. I could take care of all of the projects I listed above, but I’d have to eat into time that I spend on other things, like spending time with my children.

The truth is this: I want to spend every dollar and every moment of my life on the most valuable thing that I can spend it on. I think that’s a goal that most of us share. (It’s also a call to frugality, but that’s neither here nor there.)

My solution to all of this is simple: whenever I want something, I try not to think about how much I want that thing and how great it is; instead, I think of what I’ll have to give up to have it.



I think of how many hours I’ll have to work to buy this item, and what those hours might represent. I do this by first calculating my true hourly wage–the amount of money I have in my pocket per hour of my life devoted to work. Let’s say it’s $10 an hour for convenience sake.

If I’m at a coffee shop and I’m considering a latte and a bagel, the total might be $7.50. That means I have to give up 45 minutes of my life to work tasks to earn that coffee and a bagel. Is that really worth 45 minutes of my life, especially when I could get virtually the same thing at home for less?

Let’s say there’s a new board game I want (if you’re new here, tabletop board games are one of my main hobbies) and it costs, say, $50. Is it really worth five hours of my life lost to own this game, particularly if I have a similar game or if someone else that I regularly play games with also owns this game?
