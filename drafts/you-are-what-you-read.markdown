You are what you read
11-01-2013


Now, I have to be very honest. Over the span of the entire year, I feel like I learned very little. I read more and somehow knew less. It seems that the faster the consumption, the lower my comprehension became. 


Perhaps we arenøt exactly as Jim Rohn said, øthe average of the five people you spend the most time withø but he was definitely heading in the right direction.

Itís often said that youíre the product of the five people you spend the most time with. If you allow even one of those five people to be toxic, youíll soon find out how capable he or she is of holding you back.

n the past few decades, the fortunate among us have recognised the hazards of living with an overabundance of food (obesity, diabetes) and have started to change our diets. But most of us do not yet understand that news is to the mind what sugar is to the body. News is easy to digest. The media feeds us small bites of trivial matter, tidbits that don't really concern our lives and don't require thinking. That's why we experience almost no saturation. Unlike reading books and long magazine articles (which require thinking), we can swallow limitless quantities of news flashes, which are bright-coloured candies for the mind. Today, we have reached the same point in relation to information that we faced 20 years ago in regard to food. We are beginning to recognise how toxic news can be.

News is irrelevant. Out of the approximately 10,000 news stories you have read in the last 12 months, name one that ø because you consumed it ø allowed you to make a better decision about a serious matter affecting your life, your career or your business. The point is: the consumption of news is irrelevant to you. But people find it very difficult to recognise what's relevant. It's much easier to recognise what's new. The relevant versus the new is the fundamental battle of the current age. Media organisations want you to believe that news offers you some sort of a competitive advantage. Many fall for that. We get anxious when we're cut off from the flow of news. In reality, news consumption is a competitive disadvantage. The less news you consume, the bigger the advantage you have.

News wastes time. If you read the newspaper for 15 minutes each morning, then check the news for 15 minutes during lunch and 15 minutes before you go to bed, then add five minutes here and there when you're at work, then count distraction and refocusing time, you will lose at least half a day every week. Information is no longer a scarce commodity. But attention is. You are not that irresponsible with your money, reputation or health. Why give away your mind?

You are the average of ..

1. There are thousands of times as many things available to read as there were a decade ago. It's possible that in fact there are millions as many.

2. Now that everyone can write, publish, email you stuff and generally make noise, everyone might and many people already are.

As a result, there's too much noise, too much poorly written, overly written, defensively written and generally useless stuff cluttering your life.

How much time do you spend consuming information that you have no intention of taking action on or that you donít care deeply about?

For example: the nightly news cycle of local crimes, the endless stream of Facebook and Twitter updates, celebrity gossip, reality TV shows, Buzzfeed articles. The list goes on.

In this age of information overload, your life can be filled with irrelevant or unnecessary information in an instant.

And hereís the main problem:

After a while, these information sources start to become normal. Pretty soon, youíre logging onto Facebook because of the fear of missing out on ìsomething.î You turn on the news or check CNN, not because you care about a particular topic, but merely out of habit. You watch tonightís reality TV show because thatís what you always do on Thursdays at 8pm.

Now donít get me wrong, Iím all for learning and soaking up new information. After all, education is one of the master keys to the universe. And staying up-to-date on important stories can help shape your worldview and make you a good global citizen.

But it is becoming dangerously easy to consume low quality information and convince yourself that itís normal and good, when it isnít helping you live a better life at all.

The world doesnít need more people who mindlessly digest whatever information is around. What the world needs are people who learn with purpose, who take action on the things that are important to them, and who seek out high quality information as a way to spark creativity ó not as an excuse to consume even more.

What type of food are you feeding your brain? You wouldnít want to stuff your body with low quality food. Why cram your mind with low quality thoughts?

Circles of Concern vs. Circles of Control

In Steven Coveyís best-selling book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, he covers the difference between Circles of Concern and Circles of Control.

Circles of Concern are the things that you often waste time and energy worrying about, but that you have little to no control over. Meanwhile, Circles of Control are the things that you can influence in your daily life.

As an example, the vast majority of news stories ó war and terrorism, the economy and stock prices, celebrity gossip and political scandal ó fall squarely in the Circle of Concern. They can easily soak up your time and energy, but you have virtually no control over those events.

Other examples include getting angry about what someone posted on Facebook, worrying about what other people think about you, or wishing your kids would make better choices (a valid wish, but still outside of your control).

As you can see in the image below, worrying about Circles of Concern is a hallmark of reactive people, while focusing on Circles of Control is a trait of proactive people.

Notice that by eliminating or reducing your Circle of Concern, you have more time and energy to put towards your Circle of Control. That means you have more mental space to use for creating art, starting a business, having meaningful conversations, or otherwise contributing to the world around you.

On the flip side, the heavy barrage of information in our society can easily push most of your time and energy into Circles of Concern if you let it. What about the war? What about the economy? What about the choices of XYZ politician? If youíre constantly surrounded by these topics itís easy to let them capture your time and energy ó even if you realize that you canít do very much about them.

When youíre overdosing on information that you canít act on itís easy to see why people say things like ìitís a messed up world out thereî or ìsomebody needs to fix it.î Why make an effort when everything seems out of your control?

Create Space, So That You Can Create

Do external things distract you? Then make time for yourself to learn something worthwhile; stop letting yourself be pulled in all directions.
óMarcus Aurelius, from his book Meditations

Time and energy that is wasted consuming is time and energy that canít be spent creating.

Iíve written previously about the importance of making things and contributing to the world around you. You learn more, experience more, and contribute more to life by doing.

Itís better to step into the arena and get your ass handed to you ó whether that means starting a business and failing, creating art that is terrible, writing something nobody reads, or taking a risk that is important to you ó than it is to passively sit and consume information.

Itís great to learn new skills, follow story lines that are important to you, and become an engaged and thoughtful citizen, but sadly most consumption doesnít fall into those categories. Most of us (myself included) have a handful of information sources that we could eliminate from our lives with no significant impact whatsoever.

What Kind of Food is Your Brain Eating?

News is to the mind what sugar is to the body. News is easy to digest. The media feeds us small bites of trivial matter, tidbits that donít really concern our lives and donít require thinking. Thatís why we experience almost no saturation. Unlike reading books and long magazine articles (which require thinking), we can swallow limitless quantities of news flashes, which are bright-coloured candies for the mind.
óRolf Dobelli

The problem with most news, gossip, and link-bait titled articles online is that they are filled with surface level information. Your life isnít better off for reading them and youíre rarely better informed because of them.

Of course, there are plenty of wonderful sources of information out there. The New York Times has many fantastic writers on various topics. As a personal example, I love learning about medicine and I often read Atul Gawandeís lengthy articles in The New Yorker. But I donít browse the internet passively and stumble upon his articles. I seek them out with intention and purpose.

And that is the main pointÖ

The world doesnít need more people who mindlessly digest whatever information is around. What the world needs are people who learn with purpose, who take action on the things that are important to them, and who seek out high quality information as a way to spark creativity ó not as an excuse to consume even more.

What type of food are you feeding your brain? You wouldnít want to stuff your body with low quality food. Why cram your mind with low quality thoughts?

Where to Go From Here

Not all news is bad. For example, learning about the latest war can make me grateful to live in a stable society and keep my life in perspective. But if weíre being honest, there is a lot of information that fills our daily lives, clogs our minds, and prevents us from creating, building, sharing, and experiencing more important things.

Most of the information you come across in your daily life ó the news stories, the social media updates, the television shows ó isnít going to change the choices you make. Instead of sitting around and consuming whatever is readily available, challenge yourself to make more conscious choices about what you consume and how you consume it.

Do you really need social media apps on your phone? Or will you be just fine checking Facebook and Twitter when you get home?

Is it necessary to turn on the same news program every night? Are you living a better life because of watching it?

If something isnít benefitting you, then eliminate it.


You’ll have less concern over what others think of you — or what you post.
You’ll have less clutter in your head from miscellaneous data that isn’t relevant. We may be biologically wired to WANT to know what our closest friends/family (aka “tribe”) are doing, but in the modern world we don’t really NEED to know this. Less clutter = more space for better, more enlightened and creative thought.
Those five minutes here and there where you get lost in the News Feed add up to hours.
You’ll be more focused as your attention won’t be fragmented every time you open a social media app (yes, that’s what viewing one-second micro-stories does to your focus).


Here’s something you already know: There is a lot of stuff on the Internet. Maybe too much stuff. Users upload more than 400 hours of video to YouTube every minute. Instagrammers post more than 80 million photos daily. During one weekend of Coachella, people tweeted 3.8 million times. (Presumably they also listened to music.) Netflix accounts for more than a third of US Internet traffic, and Facebook basically is the Internet for many people. Such enormous numbers communicate one thing: You could never read and see everything online. Not in 100 lifetimes. Not even if you never ate or peed or worked again.

YouTube is rolling out an app redesign that totally overhauls the homepage. Rather than a bunch of videos, grouped by channel or topic, you'll now see a single feed of recommended videos when you open the app.

The other obvious truth is most of the stuff on the Internet is bad. Or, to be a little more glass-half-full about it, the limitless selection means there’s certainly something out there you’d really like to see, if you could find it. But how do you find it?
