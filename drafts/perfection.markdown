Don't waste your time wishing for things you don't have. Do your best with what you have. 


When it comes to money, perfectionism can cost you. A LOT.


Probably more than you realize. Just consider these common examples¿

You¿re not super confident about your investing skills, so you hold off on investing

I¿m not exactly an investing extraordinaire. I get the concepts, I¿ve read the books, but it just doesn¿t grab me.

And sometimes that fact turns to paralysis. It¿s actually pretty common, especially among women.

In my years writing about money, I¿ve heard every reason to put off investing:

I don¿t have enough money to invest. (You could start with just $20 a month).
 I don¿t know what I¿m doing. (That¿s okay. Just read this and Go. Do. It),
I¿m 25! I¿m not retiring for like a billion years. (Correct. If you don¿t start investing, you won¿t retire for, like, a billion years).
Essentially, there¿s this super important concept called compound interest.

Compound interest is like a money snowball. The sooner you start, the bigger your snowball gets. And the bigger your snowball gets, the faster it rolls and the more snow it can pick up, which makes it even bigger, which means it can roll faster and pick up more snow. So, what does that look like in numbers?

Here¿s a breakdown from Forbes:

¿Let¿s look at what happens when you invest $10.00 per week at 8% beginning at age 30. At age 65 your initial investment of $18,200 will have grown to $99,402. That¿s $81,202 in earnings. Now, let¿s look at what your investment would be if you started 10 years earlier at age 20. Your initial investment of $23,400 would have grown to $228,563 at age 65 ¿ $129,161 more in earnings.¿





Inspiration exists, but it must be met by dedicated daily action.  Often the difference between a successful person who is satisfied with life¿s outcomes and a person who struggles to make progress is not one¿s superior abilities or ideas, but the courage that one has to bet on one¿s ideas, to take calculated risks, and to take small consistent steps forward.  In other words, unproductive people sit and wait for the magic beans to arrive while the rest of us just get up and get to work.  Remember this.  We so often create a state of suffering while we wait, when we should be stepping forward.  Stop waiting for someone to call your name and tell you it¿s time.  It is time!  Stop waiting for someone to show up and give you all the answers.  You have all the answers you need to take the next smallest step!


It is better to get started on an idea and adapt it on the fly rather than waiting for the perfect idea to formulate before starting anything. By "acting more and thinking less", you will not only immediately start to move forward and make progress, but it may spark new lines of thinking and generate a completely

Every day is a new opportunity to be better than yesterday; that pursuit can increase your self esteem and, accordingly, your happiness. I used to be obsessed with being perfect. If I wasn’t the best at something, I couldn’t sleep at night. Becoming great never felt as good as I imagined it would because there was always room to be better. I was constantly dissatisfied and disappointed in myself.

I now look at the things I do as opportunities to get better from one day to the next. It’s more satisfying to set and meet an attainable goal, like focusing better and writing an extra article tomorrow, than it is to obsess about perfection, stressing because I’m not a world-famous author.

By focusing on small improvements and mini-goals, you’ll naturally move yourself toward your larger dreams. And you’ll respect the way you’re doing things.


¿A two-year old falls down unexpectedly. He isn¿t hurt but instinctively knows he wasn¿t supposed to fall,¿ writes Bob Burg in his idea-packed new book Adversaries Into Allies. ¿He looks at Mom and Dad for an interpretation of what happened. If they laugh as though it¿s funny, he¿ll probably laugh. If they panic and act upset, he will most likely begin to cry. In either case, Mom and Dad unintentionally set the frame that led to the outcome,¿ suggests Burg.

We make that framing choice, consciously or not, many times everyday in our interactions with others. For example, the owners of this business positively framed their request by using unifying humor in the language on their outdoor sign you see to the left.

Since more people traditionally report feeling down more than up during the Christmas holidays, why not be a gift this year? Each time you meet someone in person or virtually, consider that you may be the only angel in their life right now. Set the situation for them to feel cared for, in that moment.

Also you can even ¿re-set¿ someone¿s upset reaction towards you, as Burg did when driving in a parking lot and inadvertently almost hitting a man. By quickly waving his hand in friendly apology Burg shifted the man¿s mood from anger to acceptance of the ¿waved¿ apology.
