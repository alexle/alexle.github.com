“It made me realize that you have to take advantage of the life you are given

If we had purchased our tombstone a decade earlier, I thought, how would we have lived differently?

Maybe the fourth trip to Aruba would have been replaced by Asia instead. She always wanted to go there.

Maybe we would have had more creativity in our weekly social plans. We loved watching UFC together on pay-per-view every two weeksâ€”I told you she was wonderfulâ€”but what might we have done to make those Saturday nights more distinguishable from each other?

Maybe a museum. (I think thatâ€™s how you spell it.)

Maybe not so much texting others while sitting on the couch next to each other.

My main takeaway: Make as many different memories as you can. Donâ€™t always go to the same places over and over. Don't try to replicate a great time youâ€™ve already had. Try something newâ€”and do that often.

For me, the motivation to find more depth in life for myself and for my kids is now on overdrive.

If you feel like you want to take â€œYOLOâ€ beyond a clichÃ© and into a life-altering concept, try shopping for your own tombstone. I know that you wonâ€™t actually do it. But at least take a moment and imagine that, like me, you HAD to do it.

Then ask yourself, how would you live your life?
