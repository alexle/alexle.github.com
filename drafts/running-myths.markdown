Many runners know this feeling: a sharp pain on the outside of the knee. At first, it only occurs when you run, but later you also feel it when you climb the stairs or even when you walk. Runner’s Knee, also known as ITBS (Iliotibial Band Syndrome)
Most of the time, these problems are a result of improper technique, incorrect training and underdeveloped muscles. 
Improve your running technique
Proper running technique does not come from just logging miles. Unfortunately, over the years, our motor skills begin to deteriorate. On account of very supportive or cushioned shoes, well-paved roads and paths and a largely sedentary lifestyle, our bodies are losing the muscle tension necessary to perform the movements involved in running. “The result is most often poor running technique like overstriding or “sitting in the bucket.” Your body needs to be reminded of its natural running form from time to time,” emphasizes Sascha, who has put together a few tips below for rediscovering your natural form.

1. Don't zone out ¿ think about the race.
How do marathoners pass the time? Anyone who hasn't run a marathon might assume runners are zoning out, daydreaming of beer at the finish line or a triple-cheese pizza waiting on their kitchen table.

Not the case, according to Bauhs. While it does depend on the runner and his or her motivations, Bauhs says many serious runners are spending most of the race thinking about their pace, hitting splits, and monitoring their competitors.

"For the most part, I'm not thinking about much outside of the race. I'm ignoring just about everything except for the road in front of me and the guys around me, and then trying to assess how I feel and pay attention to the course," he says.

Bauhs doesn't listen to music when he runs. He's never actively trying to zone out when running, he says, because he has to be focused, at least somewhat, at all times.


He assesses the competition.

"You see it, you acknowledge it, but when I'm racing I'm focusing on the task at hand. I'm looking at the runners around me and gauging how they're feeling," he says. "Is their breathing labored or is their form breaking down?

"Staying with a pack running at a pace close to his own is key in a marathon, Bauhs explains, so he's constantly trying to assess whether he's running next to the right people. He looks at runners' posture and how they're holding their arms to judge their physical condition.

"If their posture is pretty straight, and their arm movements are snappy, you see they look like they're still full of energy. If they're starting to droop more, and it looks forced to keep the same rhythm they've been maintaining, they're starting to lose energy."
