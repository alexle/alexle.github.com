Am I Doing Something That Scares Me Every Day?



JIANG: Rejection Therapy is a game that requires people to seek rejections on purpose by making difficult requests to strangers. The goal is to desensitize the participants from the fear and pain of rejection.

ACT: You've been on a 100-day journey to face 100 potential rejections. How has your opinion about rejection changed since day 1?
JIANG: Here is what I learned about rejection that I didn’t know before:

+ In life, rejection is certain. Once you accept this fact, it will be easier to anticipate and to overcome moments of rejection.

+ Detach yourself from the results of a request, and you will become more confident and increase your chance for acceptance, or a “yes.”

+ The worst part of rejection is the fear of it. Do not let the fear prevent you from making your request.

+ Rejection is nothing more than someone else’s opinion. We should never consider it as truth about ourselves.

+ If we talk to enough people without giving up, a rejection will become an acceptance.

ACT: Which requests were you most surprised to see people agree to?
JIANG:  A Krispy Kreme employee agreed to make Olympic donuts and the story made national news.

A stranger agreed to let me play soccer in his backyard.

A flight attendant allowed me to make an announcement on airplane.

ACT: Why do you want to interview President Obama about rejection?
JIANG: I am an entrepreneur whose life-long goal is to help the world overcome the fear of rejection. President Obama overcame all kinds of odds to become the first minority President in the United States. I want to interview him to get his take on rejection and use it to inspire other people.

ACT: What advice do you have for someone who is, like you once were, facing a fear of rejection? 
JIANG: No one can overcome any fear by staying at home and thinking about it. You have to go out and face rejection. Rejection is really just someone’s opinion. It says as much as about the rejecter as you. Don’t take it personally. Even if you are afraid of rejection, you still need to go out and do it. The price for not putting yourself out there is rejection by default.

ACT: What the best way to get over a rejection (whether it’s from a crush or the college of your dreams!)?
JIANG: The best way to deal with rejection is to know what rejection is — an opinion. With that understanding, things become a lot easier.

The second thing is to use rejection as motivation. We hear stories that great writers such as C.S. Lewis and athletes such as Michael Jordan constantly use rejection to motivate themselves to perform at a higher level.

Lastly, keep trying. There is no such thing as permanent rejection. It’s statistically impossible to have everyone in the world reject an idea or person. Rejection is just a number. If you keep asking, you will get a ‘yes.’

ACT: You've survived the 100 days of rejection! What's next?
JIANG: I am working on a book, accepting speaking engagements and continuing to write my blog — I want to keep inspiring others to overcome their fear of rejection.


You can’t change what has already happened, so choose to look ahead instead of behind you.  Don’t stress.  Do your best.  Forget the rest.  Your past mistakes are meant to guide you, not define you.  Life is a beautiful circle.  You’re strong because you know your weaknesses.  You’re wise because you’ve been foolish.  You can laugh now because you’ve known sadness.

It’s crazy how you always end up where you’re meant to be – how even the most tragic and stressful situations eventually teach you important lessons that you never dreamed you were going to learn.  Remember, oftentimes when things are falling apart, they are actually falling into place.  Just because you’re not where you want to be today doesn’t mean you won’t be there someday.  Everything is going to be come together – maybe not today, but eventually.

Follow this daily to-do list and you’ll be just fine:

Think positively.
Eat healthy.
Exercise today.
Worry less.
Work hard.
Laugh often.
Sleep well.
Repeat…
 If you want something, you must endure the pain of working for it.  It’s that simple.  If you’re not where you want to be right now, take the time to visualize yourself in the place you want to be and take the first step in that direction.

 Tough situations build strong, successful people


 Never force anything.  Do your best, then let it be.  If it’s meant to be, it will be.  Don’t hold yourself down with things you can’t control.  Stop talking about the problem and start thinking about the solution
