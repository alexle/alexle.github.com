Embrace Running Up Hills
06-14-2016


Many people shy away from hills. THey take it easy on themselves, but that limits their improvement.

If youÕre lucky enough to have two good options, always go with the one that scares you the most, because thatÕs the one that is going to help you grow.


Feel strong, confident, healthy. Start to believe what you thought was impossible, really wasn't. Then you believe you can do anything.

When I first started running, I hated hills. A

This simple mentality has many benefits. First, it reduces the burden of stress that usually accompanies any new problem--because the problem is viewed in a positive light, it's less intimidating. Second, it contextualizes the problem. Because the mind immediately starts thinking about the effects and potential responses to the problem, it can be broken down and analyzed easier. Third, it encourages growth--this mentality forces you to adapt and improve on a constantly recurring basis. Finally, it's self-perpetuating. Every problem you view or solve this way makes future problems easier to handle, forming a positive cycle of reinforcement.

Adding hill running to your training is a great way to get more fitness bang for your workout buck. A hilly five-mile run will challenge you more and stimulate greater fitness gains than a flat run of the same distance. Specifically, running uphill develops aerobic capacity and leg strength, while running downhill improves leg “stiffness” and running economy.
Don't Skip Running Up Hills



Nothing builds running strength better than hills. Running inclines forces your muscles to work harder with each step; as you grow stronger, your stride becomes more efficient and your overall speed improves. Despite the benefits, many newcomers (and old-timers) avoid hills–after all, defying gravity can be physically and mentally uncomfortable. But simple form adjustments and a go-slow approach can reduce the challenges and boost your fitness.




Maintain good form-> As you ascend, shorten your stride and keep your feet low to the ground. Try to keep your head, chest, and hips perpendicular to an imaginary horizontal line. On descents, take short, quick, light steps and keep your center of gravity over your legs.

Start easy-> For your first hill workout, jog for 10 minutes to warm up, then walk for two minutes. From the bottom of a gentle incline, run up at an easy pace for five seconds, then walk back to the starting point. Run up again for seven seconds. Walk down. Run for 10 seconds, then walk down. If you're feeling strong, repeat the sequence. Cool down with a 15-minute jog.

There are various ways to incorporate hills into your training. You can do your weekend long run on a hilly route, run a set of intervals uphill or downhill (e.g. 6 x 2 minutes uphill @ 5K effort), or do a few 10-second uphill sprints after completing an easy run for a quick power-building stimulus.

Naturally, you don’t want to hit the hills every day, but be sure that not a week goes by without your doing some hill running.

After one particularly challenging period, however, he had an epiphany. He realized that while he couldn¿t control his luck, he could control how he reacted. Perhaps his bad luck wasn¿t bad luck at all, but actually an opportunity to prove himself. His entire mentality changed that day. Instead of dreading problems, he began to actively seek them out. ¿Where¿s the next problem?¿ became his personal mantra, and it became the basis for his entire business philosophy.
