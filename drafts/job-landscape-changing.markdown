Yes, The Job Landscape is Changing: Here’s What to Do About It

This ain’t your grandparents’ career path.

If you listen to your parents or grandparents talk about their work history, you’ll probably see an alarming trend — they didn’t go anywhere! They stayed at the same company year after year, often decade after decade. Compare that to the average job length as of January 2016: Just 4.2 years.

In fact if we look at the job landscape, a lot has changed in the past 50 years:

Flexible work arrangements continue to shake up the traditional workplace environment. For example, a Gallup study found that 37% of US workers have telecommuted at some point “four times greater than the 9% found in 1995.” While salary is still the key factor in choosing a job, a 2014 Cisco study found that “the flexibility to set your own work schedule” ranked second among Gen X and Gen Y.
Job hopping is becoming more and more common as workers chase different positions, challenging problems, and, of course, better perks (all without the retirement pensions of yore motivating them to stick around).
Freelancing continues to rise constituting 35% of the US workforce in 2016.

Master the fundamentals, not the specifics.
In his book A More Beautiful Question, author Warren Berger contrasts the difference between the current job climate and years past. In the past, adults would go to school, figure out what they wanted to do for a career, and then continue to do that work year after year for the rest of their lives.

“[B]ecause of constant change and increased complexity, that rinse-and-repeat approach to adult life no longer works as well,” says Berger. “In a time when so much of what we know is subject to revision or obsolescence, the comfortable expert must go back to being a restless learner.”

Industries are changing so rapidly that it’s no longer enough to know the ins and outs of your specific niche. You need to be adaptable. If your niche becomes obsolete for whatever reason, you need to learn a new aspect and push forward. Instead of memorizing a specific set of tactics for your craft, master the strategic thinking behind them; know the industry in and out, not just a certain set of tools.

For example, if you’re a growth marketer, Facebook ads and email marketing might be the titans of your space at the moment. In 20 years, it may be a different story. If you only understand those specific tools, you’ll be out of luck. If, instead, you master the skills of thinking strategically, testing new approaches to attracting customers, and learning from the results, you’ll excel regardless of whatever tool is popular.

How exactly do you master the 

How exactly do you master the fundamentals? As you might expect from the book title, A More Beautiful Question hints that better questions might actually be the answer. Berger explains the future of work in this way:

“…we’ll be expected to quickly adapt to using new and unfamiliar tools, as we try to construct new businesses, new markets, new careers, new life plans — using ever-changing technology, without clear instructions, and with the clock ticking. All of which requires people to be not only better questioners, but better experimenters.”
Here are two questions to get you started. Use these as thought experiments to kick your mind into a new way of thinking.

If you had to do your job now without your favorite tool or set of tools, how would you do it? For example, if you were a marketer and you had to reach a large audience without email or social media, how would you get it done? Similarly, if you’re a developer and you can’t use your preferred language, how quickly could you ship a project in something else?
What assumptions are you making about your industry that might change on a dime? How would you react? A simple example is the shift from desktop to mobile devices. In 2010, many companies just assumed their customers would come to them over desktop computers. Enter the mobile revolution. What’s the equivalent shift that could happen in your space? How would you react?

Build a (focused) portfolio of your work.
Even if you’re not looking for a new job, build an online portfolio showcasing your work. If you’re a web designer, you should have design samples you can showcase to friends and potential clients. If you’re an entrepreneur on Etsy, create a quick portfolio of your best work outside of your Etsy shop.

Your portfolio shouldn’t encompass all of your work. It should encompass your best stuff and represent the type of work you want to get hired for moving forward. Remember that tip to narrow your market a few paragraphs ago? Your portfolio should be catered to that audience. Behance’s Brand Director, Mark Brooks, explained it this way for designers:

“Your portfolio defines who you are as a designer and where you want to go. If you have a specific interest in a certain design field such as editorial design, that’s what you need to focus your portfolio on.”
You can expand this to virtually any field. If you’re a writer looking to work exclusively on long-form profile pieces, don’t fill your portfolio with the shorter, regular columns you write on a weekly basis. If you’re a developer, show off the projects built in the languages you want to specialize in.

When viewing your portfolio, it should be easy for someone to pull out two things — what you’re good at and what kinds of work you enjoy doing.


Google yourself regularly.
Your future employers and business partners are likely googling you. You should know what they’re seeing. The only way to do that is to regularly google yourself and keep tabs on what’s coming up in the top search results. Ideally, these top results will contain your website, personal projects, and online networks you’ve chosen to focus on (more on that below).

To stay on top of your Google reputation, follow these two steps:

Go incognito. For the best results, Rich Matta, CEO of ReputationDefender, recommends running a search in an incognito window. Otherwise, your search results will be heavily influenced by your browsing habits, current location, etc. By doing the search in an incognito window, you can be sure you’re seeing what anyone else would see.
Set up a Google alert. You can automatically get notified when your name pops up in new search results through Google. For example, I have mine set up to automatically notify me when my name appears in new searches with at most one email per day. I don’t get a ton of emails through this, but it gives me peace of mind know that it’s in place.
