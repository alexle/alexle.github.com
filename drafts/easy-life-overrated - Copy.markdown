"The size of our life is in direct proportion to how uncomfortable we're willing to be," Levy says.

I wish you an incredibly uncomfortable life.



Don't get me wrong. I'm all for easy days as much as the next person. Our bodies and minds need time to rest, to recharge, and reflect.

Next time you're faced with hardship, embrace it. It's an value

There is value in hardship

YOU have to embrace hard work. Hard work creates grit. It gives us a sense of pride, purpose, and accomplishment; without which, we can never truly feel as though we’re giving our best to this dying flame we call life, or our true value to the rest of those we’re connected to on this planet.

Instead of looking forward to a future of ease, embrace your present hardships, and look to add more strain to your life. This is how you grow. This is how you evolve. This is how you live.

I’m sure we can all agree that a successful life, in part, is one truly lived. That is, a life filled with accomplishment, adventure, highs and lows, struggle, defeat, and victory. A life is filled with action, not ease.

Life without challenges is boring.

So tell me. Do you still want an easy life?


 Never in history has the easy life led to a great life. Not in one case has something great come without tribulation, struggle, or failure. Instead of fearing struggle, strain, and tribulation, you should embrace it; nay, seek it at every opportunity, and incorporate it into your life daily. It’s in struggle that you experience growth. It’s in conquering obstacles that you experience life.

## An Easy Life Is Boring

 If we ran great races all the time and won and everything came easy it would be a pretty boring life. A little adversity builds characte



Dan Bilzerian: The sweet is never as sweet without the bitter.

I have an interesting outlook on that because I’ve bought pleasure for so long.

You can’t buy happiness. You can buy pleasure though.

A lot of people will say “oh money isn’t happiness but money can buy you a boat, and a boat will make you happy”.

When I was 16, my dream car was a Mustang Cobra. So if I got a Mustang Cobra, I would have been at a 10.

But, a Ferrari would also bring me to a 10, but you can’t get higher than a 10.

Let’s just say, I got a Ferrari when I was 16, and now we flash forward and I graduate college and my dad gives me a BMW M5.

If I had the Ferrari, now I’ll be at a 7. Because I’m stepping down on the car. But if I had the Mustang Cobra, now I’m going to an M5, I’ll be back at a 10.

It’s the same car, you’re the same person, you’re at the same spot in life, the only difference is your perspective because of your previous experience.

When people ask why rich people aren’t as happy, I just think it’s because they’ve upped the bar so far that only the best things satisfy them.

When I got out of bootcamp, I went to Outback Steakhouse, I am at a 10.

Now if I go to the best restaurant in the world, I might be at a 6 or 7. I’m just satisfied. I got 3 chefs, I eat the best food all the time. That doesn’t make me happy anmore.

If somebody bought me a Lamborghini, I’d be “whatever”. I’ve had them, I don’t care.

But if you give it to a guy off the street, he’d be at a 10.



So I can’t buy happiness anymore. I’ve bought everything that I ever wanted. There’s not really anything I want anymore.

If you gave me a regular car, and put me in a regular hotel, I would be below the normal level. Whereas a normal person, would be happy to be on a vacation.

That has some correlation. A guy that wins the lottery, a year later he is statistically less happy than a guy that got his leg amputated, a year prior.

Joe Rogan: That’s interesting. It’s also what are you trying to do. There are a lot of people who are trying to get rich because they think once they’ll be rich, they’ll be happy. They think that that’s going to give them this thing that they’ve always been missing. So they’ve been working hard, busting their ass, and they look at all these other people.

You land your private jet, you drive your Bentley to the club. You want to be that guy.

But once you’re that guy, that doesn’t mean anything anymore.

So for a lot of people, there’s this emptiness. There’s nothing left to chase. There’s nothing else to do. And your life is just about possessions and upping the ante. And now I gotta get a yacht. And now I gotta get the biggest yacht. And now I need to buy an island. Trying to find something to fill that void because you’ve sort of set your life up to chase these material goals, instead of to try to find out what actually does make you happy.

Dan: Yeah, you have to have goals. You gotta be climbing the mountain. Because at the end of the day, climbing the mountain is far more satisfying than being at the top of the mountain.








  We live in a quick-fix society. Everyone is looking for that single, magical diet or miracle workout plan that will change their lives overnight. But that�s a fiction, a false promise�and it�s exactly the one that all the health and fitness magazines love to promise their readers


We�re not prepared. We�re not prepared for the sacrifices, for the compromises, for the unconditional love. We�re not ready to invest all that it takes to make a relationship work. We want everything easy. We�re quitters. All it takes is a single hurdle to make us crumble to our feet. We don�t let our love grow, we let go before time.

We look for instant gratification in everything we do � the things we post online, the careers we choose, and the people we fall in love with. We want the maturity in a relationship that comes with time, the emotional connect that develops over years, that sense of belonging when we barely even know the other person. Apparently, nothing�s worth our time and patience � not even love.

I want to tell my stories, but a story isn�t authentic when it�s told with manufactured moments and filtered photos. I�m not going to promote the highs without also being upfront about the lows. Because let�s face it, glorifying this lifestyle is taking the easy way out. It�s easy to upload album after album to social media. It�s easy to snap a video of the Northern Lights, or a selfie in front of Machu Picchu. It�s hard to talk about getting up at 5am to work as a tour guide, or how much you miss your friends and family. It�s hard to admit, even to yourself, that the lifestyle of a world traveler is imperfect.

You know you should be doing something���whether that�s working on your project, being present with your loved ones, eating healthy, or a number of other things���and you knowingly act in contradictory ways.

Your behaviors directly translate into your results.

Nobody goes to the gym to feel good. They go there to sweat and scream and stretch themselves. And they leave better versions of the people that entered an hour before. If you�re going to grow, life will at times be hard. Get used to it.


 Happiness comes from embracing the now. Not letting those moments pass you by. Nothing in life is permanent. Kids grow up. Friends move away. Our loved ones pass on from this life. Let�s live in the present and appreciate the most important things in our lives before it�s too late.


Do You Face Adversity? If So, You're Lucky

“Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.”  -  Dalai Lama


“A fit physique is the ultimate status symbol. No money can buy it, you cannot inherit it, you cannot steal it, you cannot borrow it. You cannot hold on to it without constant work. It shows patience, passion, and discipline. It is true wealth.”

Nevertheless, I feel compelled to defend the pursuit of speed in running. I believe that the effort to run as fast as one can in events can greatly enrich the running experience, and I would feel pretty good about converting a few current finish line seekers into future PR chasers.


Human psychology is designed in such a way that we derive a great and lasting sense of pride and self-respect from completing difficult and meaningful tasks. That’s what makes crossing a marathon finish line for the first time such a magical experience for so many runners. It is satisfying in direct proportion to how difficult it was to get there. One of the major reasons marathon running has become so popular is that it is so damn hard to finish a marathon. Running is not really supposed to be fun in the moment; it’s supposed to strengthen your self-image when you’re not running by allowing you to know yourself—not fancy yourself, but know yourself—as something of a dragon slayer.

An easy life is an unfulfilling life. In Man’s Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl wrote, “What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for some goal worthy of him. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost, but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him.” Modern society, with its heated seats and its online shopping and its pill for every discomfort, has become so suffocatingly easy that we need to go out of our way for opportunities to strive and struggle and thereby cultivate self-respect. Running goals fit the bill beautifully. Frankl nailed it in saying, “Sports allow men to build up situations of emergency. What he then demands of himself is unnecessary achievement—and unnecessary sacrifice. He artificially creates the tension that he has been spared by affluent society.”

So most runners, whether they aim for finish lines or personal-best finish times, are really after the same thing. But merely reaching the finish line only scratches the itch as long as it remains challenging. When you get to the point where completing the race is no big deal, you almost have to become a PR-seeker to continue earning that wonderful feeling of satisfaction you can only get from walking through the finish chute thinking, I ran absolutely as hard as I could. I faced the pain and the doubt and I did not back down one inch.


If you ask the average person on the street what is the most fulfilling thing he or she has done, and then ask the same person what is the hardest thing he or she has ever done, you’re likely to hear the same answer twice. It’s the same way with running. Your hardest race is the one that you will remember most fondly. Pursuing the goal of completing the race as fast as you can, versus merely completing it, is how you set yourself up to make your races as hard and therefore as fulfilling as they can be.


but racers get a double portion. While runners who just cruise through marathons at the back of the pack may suffer less than those who fight for every second, let’s be real: running is hard at any pace and that’s half the reason we do it. Trying to impose hedonistic values—the idea that the runner who has the most fun is the true race winner—is like trying to cram a square peg into a round hole. If all you care about is pleasure, I can suggest a few dozen better things to do than run a marathon.

What’s great is that this psychic benefit of pursuing speed is available to everyone. You don’t actually have to be fast to earn it. Ultimately, even those who are capable of winning races are competing against themselves, and find greater satisfaction in a hard-earned second-place finish than an easy victory. I believe that some runners who disparage the effort to run fast do so because they are jealous of the speed of faster runners. That’s a terrible mistake. Forget about the genetic freaks. Focus on beating your best past self and you will get just as much out of the race as the man and woman who break the tape far ahead of you.



For those who have a propensity to quit way too soon, please have a read. There are just too many people who never achieve their full potential due to not sticking things out.

You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.

If stories have taught us anything, it’s this: success is defined by adversity. More specifically, success is victory in the face of adversity. Without it, success is at best unearned. At worst, meaningless. This means that obstacles, hardships, and failures are all part of the game. There’s no escape.

In contemplating nature, we learn the importance of balance. There is an old Arabic proverb, �Sunshine all the time makes a desert.�

Don’t let that dishearten you; in fact, it should encourage you. Success favors the relentless, not the talented. But more than that, the sweetness of success comes from the tears and sweat that were shed getting there. Just as a story that lacks an antagonist is boring, success without adversity isn’t much of a success at all.


It doesn’t matter if you win or not. What matters is that you try anyway.

Is your persistence bogged down by a lack of motivation? The key is to slay fear, procrastination, and apathy.

It’s not an enemy to fear. It’s actually a good thing — when you’re uncomfortable, you are trying something new, you’re learning, you’re expanding, you’re becoming more than you were before. Discomfort is a sign that you’re growing.

While others stay in their comfort zone, I explore the unknown. And I treasure the experience.

However, I’ve learned by my own experience and by absorbing the writings of others that seeking comfort does not lead to a life that is fulfilling, purposeful, and impactful.

Here are a few reasons why that is and why it’s good to seek discomfort:

1. You’ll have fewer regrets. The path that is comfortable is going to be the path that is right in front of you, the one that has been laid out by circumstances and those around you. However, if you blindly coast down this path, you’re going to get to the end of your life with plenty of deathbed regrets.

2. You won’t be stuck with a boring life. By doing what is easy and comfortable, we tend to not give it our 100% and settle into a life that’s pretty mediocre. It’s better to learn, expand, and hone our life skills. Tackle some new challenges, take on a new adventure.

3. You’ll be more prepared for the unexpected. By coasting along and just taking whatever comes down the pike, we become quite vulnerable. Mike Zimmerman says, “Once you gravitate towards comfort, you tend to assume the status quo, and that can leave you unprepared for the moment when your world tanks.” Seeking out discomfort will help keep you sharp.

Even though it’s not easy or, well, comfortable to seek discomfort, in the end, it will get us to where we want to go.

Problems are a given--only the intensity of the problems are a variable. If you can learn to accept problems as a normal, regular, and completely unavoidable part of life, you'll have taken your first step toward handling them with more grace and objective understand




The students who had pursued meaning said they felt more “enriched,” “inspired,” and “part of something greater than myself.” They also reported fewer negative moods. Over the long term, it seemed, pursuing meaning actually boosted psychological health.

Parenthood can be a pain in the ass. But it also brings tremendous meaning to life. Don’t sell your kids on the black market just yet. Meaning is the tortoise. Happiness is the hare. You remember who won that race? Exactly.
