financial tips:


1. When I set my resolutions in January, taking control of my finances and being smart about the way I spend and save topped the list—but here we are in December, and I've hardly taken any steps to get there. As 2018 approaches, I decided to finally quit procrastinating and take the first, albeit very delayed, step to meet with a financial planner.

My case is hardly unique: A new study by Fidelity Investments found that single women are less likely to consider themselves knowledgeable about money compared to men, and only 28% have an actual financial plan. Given I'm just about to turn 28, hope to buy a house in the next five years, and want to put an end to financial fights with my S.O., this meeting was long overdue.

Here are the most valuable lessons I learned from chatting with Jenn Imbeault, CFP, vice president of Fidelity Investments Shrewsbury Investor Center. After just one meeting, my financial anxiety dissipated, and I feel more control of my future. As it turns out, it wasn't so scary after all.

Plan for Upcoming Milestones

The first thing Imbeault asked about were the milestones in my future: Did I hope to get married, buy a house, or make any other significant changes that might impact my finances? This helps create a map for the future so you can understand your big-picture needs and plan accordingly.

"I like to write down what it is I want to accomplish, then prioritize them on a timeline," she explains. "What's coming next in my life? If it's marriage, how do I pay for that? If I want to buy a house one day, what does that involve?" She recommends going further than simply acknowledging these milestones—it's important to create a clear picture and, in my case, talk openly to my S.O. to make sure we're on the same page. "I write details under each priority so I can visualize what I need to do. So, if you think you'll need to fund a wedding in the near future, have an open conversation with your partner about what that looks like. How much are you willing to spend? What's it going to take to get there?"

It might seem daunting, but it's an important conversation if you want to feel in control of your financial future. "The more detailed you can be in your priorities, the more visual it becomes, and the more likely your plan will come to fruition," she says, noting that this method helped her buy a house. "I knew where I wanted to live and in what kind of house, and then I did the math. It was about two years in the making, but I'm not kidding you, writing things down really helped."

2. Involve Your S.O. in the Discussion

The American Psychological Association found that money is the number one cause of stress in relationships, so talking to a financial planner shouldn't be a solo venture. "I think it's critical to have the two of you in a meeting," Imbeault told me when I mentioned that my boyfriend and I have different saving and spending habits. "If this is going to be about the two of you moving forward, then financial planning needs to be joint. Not each of you doing your own thing."

A typical session with a couple isn't as intimidating as it sounds. "I will ask you about your priorities, and then I will ask your partner the same question so we can come to a middle ground," she explains. "It's important for both of you to hear each other's perspective. Then you have a third person to mediate."

3.Align Your Accounts With Your Goals

Apparently, your bank accounts should each have a specific purpose and mirror your goals. "This helps keep your financial priorities separate," she explains. "If you have a joint checking that's used for emergency funds, savings, and to pay bills, it's easy to lose track." Instead, she recommends having at least three accounts tailored to a purpose:

The Only 4 Money Rules You Need to Follow to Become Rich

Pay yourself first - If you pay yourself first, saving money will no longer be the last item on your to-do list that never gets done. Instead, money can be withdrawn directly from your paycheck and invested in a retirement account, as well as a savings account for essentials like an emergency fund. You'll never get a chance to spend the cash that you should be investing. 

. Save for a rainy day - If a financial disaster happens and you're not prepared, the effects can reverberate throughout your life. A broken down car leads to missed work, causing a job loss or reduced income. A lost job leads to foreclosure or the repossession of your vehicle. Delayed medical care leads to a serious illness. A financial cushion protects you from the far-reaching damage unexpected expenses can cause -- and can keep you out of debt. 

Live below your means

 Never go into debt for depreciating assets



After making the conscious decision to tackle her debt at the start of 2015, Garrido picked up a side hustle to generate more income, but she also focused on slashing her day-to-day expenses. "I only gave myself $300 per paycheck for everything besides fixed costs, so groceries, gas, food, going out to eat and entertainment," Garrido tells CNBC Make It.

And she came up with a brilliant strategy that forced her to stick to her strict budget: She opened a separate checking account with a separate debit card and moved $300 from each paycheck into that account. Once she went through the $300, she couldn't spend any more until her next paycheck hit. It was like she put herself on a "cash diet."

While Garrido was spending significantly less than she was used to, she didn't feel deprived: She viewed her situation as having the freedom to spend $300 per paycheck. As she puts it, "It was like a diet where you could do whatever you want within a certain amount of calories."

Plus, she changed her mindset around spending and focused on "being grateful for what I already had," she says. "Especially in this day and age, with social media, you compare yourself to other people — you see where they are traveling and what they have, so you are tempted to compete with them and have the same things and buy more things. But I found that when you put yourself in a place of gratitude, you feel content and you don't have to have all that stuff and then you just work on yourself."

Her discipline paid off. Over the three years and three months she spent paying off her debt, she put an average of $1,800 a month towards her debt. Garrido, who meticulously tracked her income and expenses, says her biggest monthly payment was $3,418.




Many experts, including Vanguard, suggest that most of us need to add 12% to 15% of our compensation to our 401(k) plan accounts every year we work. Money magazine indicates that the average 401(k) participant adds 10.9% to 12.9% to a 401(k) account each year (employee contributions plus employer contributions). That seems to be right on track. However, if we look at the way most of us normally contribute, that range is way too low.

How most of us normally contribute

In real life, many of us don't contribute in a uniform way to our 401(k) plans. Early in our careers, when we are just getting started, we tend to battle with competing saving and spending priorities. We are trying to pay off student loans, buy a car or save for a down payment on a home. Or, surprise, we may end up having kids!


As a result, during that first 10 years of our 40-year careers, most of us contribute very little (or nothing) to our 401(k) plans. At that time in our lives, retirement seems pretty far off anyway and those student loans look pretty scary. We often change jobs frequently as we try to figure out what we want to do with our lives and, unfortunately, many of us end up taking distributions of our 401(k) balances rather than rolling them over.

Generally, most of us are in our 30s when we begin to consider saving more seriously for our retirement. We now own homes, are a little more established in our careers and are earning more. Typically, we contribute the amount that will allow us to collect the maximum company matching contribution. The most common employer matching contribution is 50% of the first 6% of employee contributions. So we end up adding 9% on average to our 401(k) accounts during our 30s.

During the last 20 years of our careers, we begin to panic as we realize that we haven't been contributing enough. Retirement is no longer a distant thought but is moving closer to reality. For these years, we may contribute as much as we possibly can. If we look at our contribution history and apply a little math, many of us end up with the following:

Early career contributions (first 10 years):                   0%

Mid-career contributions (second 10 years):               9%

Mid-career contributions (third 10 years):                15%

Late career contributions (final 10 years):                 18%

Average contribution rate over 40 years:                10.50%

Required minimum average contribution rate:     12.00%

As an investment advisor who has worked with the retirement plans of Apple, IBM and AT&T, I often receive questions from participants about how much they should contribute. I typically respond by saying, "At least 20%." They usually laugh and say, "No, really." And I repeat, "Really, at least 20%."

I can hear what you are thinking, "Not much of a difference Bob, what's the point?" There are two problems with how we contribute. First, the problem that can't be fixed.

Back-loading rather than front-loading

All of us understand the power of compounding. That's when your savings magically increase over time because of interest on interest. Well, that is not what we are experiencing in our typical contribution patterns, as outlined above.

We are back-loading contributions into our accounts rather than front-loading, contributing a lot at the end of our careers and very little at the beginning. As a result, we are missing out on all of that compounding that takes place over time. So we end up with a 401(k) account balance that is way too low.
