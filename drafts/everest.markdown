You Don't Climb Mt Everest By Accident

When you're trying to reach a goal, it's comforting to focus on the milestones. However, a better target for your attention may be the incremental process improvements that will get you there.

As writer James Clear explains, many successes aren't major events, even if we see them that way. Rather, they're the sum total of small, incremental improvements that are made consistently. Doodling in a notebook may not seem like an important task, but no one's able to create a magnificent painting without thousands of those doodles that come before it:

Most people love to talk about success (and life in general) as an event. We talk about losing 50 pounds or building a successful business or winning the Tour de France as if they are events. But the truth is that most of the significant things in life aren't stand-alone events, but rather the sum of all the moments when we chose to do things 1 percent better or 1 percent worse. Aggregating these marginal gains makes a difference.
