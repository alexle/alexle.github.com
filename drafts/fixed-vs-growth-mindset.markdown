Give Up The Fixed Mindset
øThe future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways.ø ø Robert Greene, Mastery
People with a fixed mindset think their intelligence or talents are pre-determined traits that cannot be changed. They also believe that talent alone leads to successøøøwithout hard work. But theyøre wrong.

Successful people know this. They invest an immense amount of time on a daily basis to develop a growth mindset, acquire new knowledge, learn new skills and change their perception so that it can benefit their lives.

Who you are today is not who you have to be tomorrow.



hey have a growth mindset.

Peopleøs core attitudes fall into one of two categories: a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. With a fixed mindset, you believe you are who you are and you cannot change. This creates problems when youøre challenged, because anything that appears to be more than you can handle is bound to make you feel hopeless and overwhelmed. People with a growth mindset believe that they can improve with effort. This makes them happier because they are better at handling difficulties. They also outperform those with a fixed mindset because they embrace challenges, treating them as opportunities to learn something new.





Because they factor opportunity and value their time, abundance thinkers are happy to spend money on products or processes that enable them to increase their personal and professional resources.

They freely share what they know and learn from others. They buy books, take courses, and attend conferences. They outsource tasks theyøre not proficient or passionate about. They upgrade their knowledge and their toolkits.

Theyøre not satisfied with incremental improvements when they can make leapfrog gains toward their goals. And they always have big goals because they arenøt trapped by limiting beliefs about whatøs possible.

Scarcity thinking costs you all of those gains.



Abundance thinkers keep their eyes on opportunities. Scarcity thinkers ask how much something will cost if they take action. Abundance thinkers count that cost, but they also ask how much it will cost if they donøt.
They frame the issue differently. Instead of factoring the expense, they also factor the opportunity.

Abundance thinkers place a high value on their time. Scarcity thinkers pinch pennies but are spendthrifts with their hours. Take the Evernote example.

How many hours does it take to research, switch, and learn a new platformøall to save $20? My time is worth more than a few cups of coffee. I bet yours is too.

Abundance thinkers trade small dollars for high-value time, and reinvest their hours in pursuits that will earn double, triple, or a hundred times the money.




However, not everyone realizes this. Dr. Carol Dweck of Stanford University has been studying people‚Äôs mindsets towards learning for decades. She has found that most people adhere to one of two mindsets: fixed or growth. Fixed mindsets mistakenly believe that people are either smart or not, that intelligence is fixed by genes. People with growth mindsets correctly believe that capability and intelligence can be grown through effort, struggle and failure. Dweck found that those with a fixed mindset tended to focus their effort on tasks where they had a high likelihood of success and avoided tasks where they may have had to struggle, which limited their learning. People with a growth mindset, however, embraced challenges, and understood that tenacity and effort could change their learning outcomes. As you can imagine, this correlated with the latter group more actively pushing themselves and growing intellectually.

The good news is that mindsets can be taught; they‚Äôre malleable. What‚Äôs really fascinating is that Dweck and others have developed techniques that they call ‚Äúgrowth mindset interventions,‚Äù which have shown that even small changes in communication or seemingly innocuous comments can have fairly long¬≠-lasting implications for a person‚Äôs mindset. For instance, praising someone‚Äôs process (‚ÄúI really like how you struggled with that problem‚Äù) versus praising an innate trait or talent (‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so clever!‚Äù) is one way to reinforce a growth ¬≠mindset with someone. Process¬≠ praise acknowledges the effort; talent¬≠ praise reinforces the notion that one only succeeds (or doesn‚Äôt) based on a fixed trait. And we‚Äôve seen this on Khan Academy as well: students are spending more time learning on Khan Academy after being exposed to messages that praise their tenacity and grit and that underscore that the brain is like a muscle.

The Fixed mindset says, "I am good at this" or "I am bad at this". This starts in childhood when your parents say, "You're so good at math!" You think, "I'm good at math!" But then when you do poorly on one test, you think, "They were wrong. I'm not good at math." Most people think this way. You can hear it when they say, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a great singer‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just no good at dancing.‚Äù

The Growth mindset says, "Anyone can be good at anything. Skill comes only from practice."

Two impossibly hard tests were given to hundreds of children. After the first test, all of the students were praised, but half of the students were privately told these 6 words: "You must be good at this." The other half were privately told these 6 words: "You must have worked really hard."

When they were given the second test, the students who were told, "You must be good at this", did 20% worse on the 2nd test. Those 6 words encouraged a fixed mindset that made them feel there was no point in trying. You either are or you aren‚Äôt.

The students who were told "You must have worked really hard", did 30% better on the 2nd test. Those 6 words encouraged a growth mindset that made them feel that working harder made all the difference.


Parenting Precept #1: Praise practice rather than innate ability.

The idea here is that if you tell a kid, ‚ÄúWow, you‚Äôre so great at [activity],‚Äù that becomes part of her identity, her security. But later, when doubt shows up ‚Äî and if she pursues that activity, it absolutely will when she encounters a kid who is better at it than she ‚Äî she has little to fall back on. Suddenly the belief is shattered, and so is the identity.

Instead, reinforce the belief that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm as good as I am at [activity] because I work really hard at it.‚Äù It‚Äôs a much more stable belief, and one that lots of research these days supports as a driver of success (see Malcolm Gladwell‚Äôs Outliers or Geoff Colvin‚Äôs Talent is Overrated).

I once heard Brendan Brazier say that the longer the distance of an endurance event, the more ability you have to influence your results through training. This struck me as precisely the reason why I‚Äôm a marathoner and ultrarunner: I‚Äôm not a gifted athlete, by any stretch of the imagination. But by working hard, I can improve my marathon time by 100 minutes (4:53 down to 3:09) or increase the distance I can run by 100 miles (1 mile back in gym class to 101 miles at Burning River). If I were a miler or a 5K runner, I‚Äôm not sure gains of that size (relatively speaking) would be possible.

Running long distances, then, fosters exactly the mindset I‚Äôd like my kids to have: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always going to be a kid who can do something better than me, but I have a tremendous ability to improve through hard work.‚Äù

I recently was asked by a colleague what I wish I had done differently as a parent. I gave an answer that was so boring that I can‚Äôt remember it today. But then another colleague, overhearing the question, said something that instantly resonated with me: ‚ÄúI wish I had let my kids fail more.‚Äù

A lot of parents can likely relate. We tend to protect our kids from failure and disappointment. It starts with small things. We might not let them struggle with using a fork and knife when they‚Äôre three. Or we take over their science fair projects when they‚Äôre 10. Or we heavily edit their college essays when they‚Äôre 18.

The impulse to jump in and provide support is real, but so is the cost. Each time we do these things, we cut off a lesson in resiliency and self-sufficiency. We make it harder for them to come up with better ways to do things.

The same is true in organizations where leaders and managers often prevent their employees from having to deal with setbacks‚Äîand, worse yet, from learning how to come up with new ways to solve familiar challenges, which is at the heart of innovation. When I see this, I think about my experience as a parent, and how it compares.

When my kids were younger, I arranged my business travel schedule so I could coach their baseball and soccer teams and attend their dance recitals and school events. They always tried their hardest, but sometimes they didn‚Äôt deliver. They struck out at the plate. They got beaten on defense. They didn‚Äôt land the part in the play they wanted. They bombed a few tests. It happened.

Like any parent, I instinctively wanted to catch them. Stop them from making a mistake. I had to learn to hold back, to let them see how to master whatever it was we were trying to do and hope they could adjust. I didn‚Äôt want my kids to think life was easy. I always worried, and still do, that my kids see me and my wife, two professionals with significant accomplishments, as having never struggled or failed. Building a career requires some risk-taking, not to mention some blows to the ego.

So, I tried to make sure that when they struggled, they knew they weren‚Äôt the first to do so‚Äîor the last. And that it was up to them to pick themselves up.

I often think about that experience now in my current role. What‚Äôs the best way to get our newest employees to stay motivated after struggling? How can we help them respond to failure not with surrender but with certainty that a better approach is possible? This happens to be a major challenge in the workplace, especially with the millennial generation.

This is a supremely talented group of employees. They bring incredible insight, diversity, capabilities, and a team approach to work. Millennials compose 62% of our workforce at Deloitte Consulting LLP, and that number is only increasing. They are our future.


Here is Dweckís thesis: Our genes influence our intelligence and talents, but these qualities are not fixed at birth. If you mistakenly believe that your capabilities derive from DNA and destiny, rather than practice and perseverance, then you operate with what Dweck calls a ìfixed mindsetî rather than a ìgrowth mindset.î Our parents and teachers exert a big influence on which mindset we adoptóand that mindset, in turn, has a profound impact on how we learn and which paths we take in life.   
In experiment after experiment, Dweck has shown that the fixed mindset is a huge psychological roadblockóregardless of whether you feel you were blessed with talent or not. If you have the fixed mindset and believe you were blessed with raw talent, you tend to spend a lot of time trying to validate your ìgiftî rather than cultivating it. To protect your self-identity as someone whoís super smart or gifted, you often steer clear of tough challenges that might jeopardize that identity. Hereís how Dweck puts it: ìFrom the point of view of the fixed mindset, effort is only for people with deficienciesÖ. If youíre considered a genius, a talent, or a naturalóthen you have a lot to lose. Effort can reduce you.î
If you have the fixed mindset and believe you lost the genetic lottery, you also have little incentive to work hard. Why bother putting in a lot of effort to learn a difficult concept if youíve convinced yourself that youíre lousy at it and nothing is going to alter that basic equation? When I was visiting with community college students in Arizona, one young man said to me, ìIím one of the people whoís not good at math.î It kills me when I hear that kind of thing. I think about how different things might have been if he had been told consistently ìyouíre very capable of learning this stuff.î
In contrast, people with the growth mindset believe that basic qualities, including intelligence, can be strengthened like muscles. Itís not that they believe that anyone can become the next Albert Einstein or Michael Jordan if they just work hard enough on their physics homework or fadeaway jumpers. Instead, in Dweckís words ìthey believe a personís true potential is unknown (and unknowable); that itís impossible to foresee what can be accomplished with years of passion, toil, and training.î As a result, they have every incentive to take on tough challenges and seek out opportunities to improve. 
One of the reasons I loved Mindset is because itís solutions-oriented. In the bookís final chapter, Dweck describes the workshop she and her colleagues have developed to shift students from a fixed to a growth mindset. These workshops demonstrate that ìjust learning about the growth mindset can cause a big shift in the way people think about themselves and their lives.î
My only criticism of the book is that Dweck slightly oversimplifies for her general audience. Contrary to the impression that Dweck creates here (but probably not in her academic papers), most of us are not purely fixed-mindset people or growth-mindset people. Weíre both. When I was reading the book, I realized that I have approached some things with a growth mindset (like bridge) while other things in a fixed mindset (like basketball).
