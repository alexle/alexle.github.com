The problem is that the mobile technology has now matured to a certain level where every single product at every single price point is now more than good enough to address every consumers’ key needs in almost every conceivable use-case scenario.

The hardware has now become completely commoditized, and the capabilities of these mobile chipsets and display technology have vastly outstripped the capabilities and functionality of the software applications that run on them.

We’ve seen this before, of course. It happened to the PC industry during the 1990s and the early 2000s. The commodity desktop PCs got so powerful — with the fourth- and fifth-generation x86 CPUs and the amount of memory and disk $600 to $800 could buy. It didn’t make any sense to purchase a more expensive model since real-world performance — using the same dozen or so core business applications that everyone used — was the same.

Something very similar is happening in the mobile industry right now. Everyone’s phones are now so good that it’s hard for a consumer to see real improvement over the models from the year or even two years prior.

But while the specs improved the apps on these phones did not change, nor did the end-user experience. Facebook is the same, Twitter is the same, Instagram is the same, Gmail is the same, and so is Outlook and everything else I use on these phones.

We shouldn’t expect them to be any different because they are designed to run on a certain lowest common denominator of hardware — not the most expensive hardware available.

There isn’t a “special” Facebook for more powerful iPhones or Androids. The apps don’t unlock any special feature just because your processor is faster or you have more RAM to use. Instagram doesn’t save or display photos in higher resolution because your camera captured the subject with more pixels.

My apps are just going to run the same on them anyway — for less than half the price.


You don’t really need a new smartphone.

Sure, some of them squeeze more screen into a smaller form. The cameras keep getting better, if you look very close. And you had to live under a rock to miss the hoopla for Apple’s 10th-anniversary iPhone X or the Samsung Galaxy S8. Many in the smartphone business were sure this latest crop would bring a “super cycle” of upgrades.

But here’s the reality: More and more of Americans have decided we don’t need to upgrade every year. Or every other year. We’re no longer locked into two-year contracts and phones are way sturdier than they used to be. And the new stuff just isn’t that tantalizing even to me, a professional gadget guy.



Every year, teens are asked about their general happiness, in addition to how they spend their time. We found that teens who spent more time seeing their friends in person, exercising, playing sports, attending religious services, reading or even doing homework were happier. However, teens who spent more time on the internet, playing computer games, on social media, texting, using video chat or watching TV were less happy.

In other words, every activity that didn’t involve a screen was linked to more happiness, and every activity that involved a screen was linked to less happiness. The differences were considerable: Teens who spent more than five hours a day online were twice as likely to be unhappy as those who spent less than an hour a day.

If you wanted to give advice based on this research, it would be very simple: Put down your phone or tablet and go do something – just about anything – else.
