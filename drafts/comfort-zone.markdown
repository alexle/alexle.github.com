Find Your Comfort Zone. Then Leave It.

08-01-2014


 You’ll be more prepared for the unexpected. By coasting along and just taking whatever comes down the pike, we become quite vulnerable. Mike Zimm   erman says, “Once you gravitate towards comfort, you tend to assume the status quo, and that can leave you unprepared for the moment when your world tanks.” Seeking out discomfort will help keep you sharp.

Even though it’s not easy or, well, comfortable to seek discomfort, in the end, it will get us to where we want to go.

Problems are a given--only the intensity of the problems are a variable. If you can learn to accept problems as a normal, regular, and completely unavoidable part of life, you'll have taken your first step toward handling them with more grace and objective understand

motivate you in ways that you had not dreamed of. It will show you that no matter how dark things seemed to have gotten, you were able to find a strength from within, and demonstrate that you could be successful if you out your mind to it. If you decided just to stop because things seemed hard, you would always live with that knowledge as well, and you are likely to question how you will handle it when things get rough in the future.





Our minds want to run from whatever discomfort, pain, difficulty we�re facing � and this is a good strategy for temporarily not having to deal with difficulty and pain.


Competing with those at your same level yields slow and minimal improvements.
You’re better off “competing” with people far advanced than your current level. In his book, The Art of Learning: An Inner Journey to Optimal Performance, Josh Waitzkin shares how he applied this principle to become world-class at Tai Chi.

When given unsupervised practice time, Waizkin observed that most others in his Tai Chi class would naturally practice with those at their same skill-level or slightly worse. This was done in many ways out of ego, because who wants to lose? It’s more fun to beat someone when given the opportunity.

Waitzkin took the opposite approach, and applied a principle he termed, “investing in failure.” He would purposefully practice with people far more skilled than he was. In so doing, he would get the crap kicked-out of him, over and over. However, this process compressed and quickened Waitzkin’s skill development. He could experience first-hand the abilities of those often years ahead of him. The mirror neurons in his brain allowed him to quickly mimic, match, and counter his superior competitors. Thus, he progressed much faster than others in his class.

If you don’t make big changes every once in a while, your life will get static and sterile. You’ll over-adapt to your current circumstances and stop growing. You’ll get too comfortable.

Taking on big change shatters the system of your life.



Not all good things in life are good for you. 

I learned that just because it feels good doesn’t mean it is good. Just because I want something doesn’t mean I should have it. Just because we say we love each other doesn’t mean we entirely understand what that love is.



staying in your comfort zone ultimately leads to stagnation and sometimes it can lead to fear. You'll never be able to grow and develop if you stay in one place.


Jack Canfield once said, “Everything you want is on the other side of fear.” 

Pain, discomfort, shock, boredom, impostor syndrome, awkwardness, fear, being wrong, failing, ignorance, looking stupid: your avoidance of these feelings is stopping you from a life beyond your wildest imagination.

These are the feelings that accompany a life of success. And yet, these are the very feelings you relentlessly avoid!

Interesting how that works, right?


Start small.
Life is practice.

Every day is practice. Right now, you’re practicing; you’re experimenting.

Start with small stuff and work your way up.
Do something right now you’ve been procrastinating.

Do something right now that shocks your emotional system. You’ll quickly realize it wasn’t so bad.



The choice is yours.

When something sucks, do you quit? Or do you push-through and eventually enjoy the satisfaction of growth and success?

Anything worth doing is going to suck at the beginning. Anything worth doing is meant to require pain and sacrifice. Herein lies the problem facing America, which originally was built on the moral of impulse control. What once used to be a country filled with people sacrificing momentary pleasure for a better future, the overpowering message of today is live for the moment.

And that’s exactly what people do. They live for this moment. Consequently, when something sucks, or becomes hard, most people quit. Most people indulge themselves in momentary satisfaction at the expense of a better future.








Wealth, optimal health, incredible relationships, deep spiritual maturity are all available to you. But you have to pay the price to have these things. The primary obstacle in your way is how you feel about what you need to do to have these things.

Most people aren’t willing to feel difficult emotions on a regular basis. However, if you’re willing to disregard how you feel in the moment, you’ll have access to a world of opportunity unavailable to 99% of the population.




But at the same time, I don’t want to get too comfortable. I don’t want to forget that there’s still work to be done. I want to keep my eye on the ultimate goal: financial independence.
