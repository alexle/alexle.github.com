We live in an "on demand" culture. If you want to watch your favorite show or listen to a particular song, technology has advanced so that you canøon demand. If you want to order a book, groceries, clothes, or even a car, you canøwith a few simple clicks online. We can get what we want, when we want (most of the time). And while this is a great use of technology, it doesn't translate very well when it comes to human relationships. When we mix the two, we find ourselves irritated when others don't act according to our expectations or timeline.

Patience is one of the traits of love. To be loving is to be patient. It can also be described as accepting the imperfections of others. This begins by recognizing that people are not machines. They have thoughts, feelings, and they make decisions. Those decisions will not, and do not, always line up perfectly with our expectations, so if we want peace in our emotions and relationships, we need to learn to show graceøallowing others the same freedom we want afforded to us.

If you find yourself irritated because someone is not acting within your expectations, take a step back, be patient, show some grace, and give him or her the freedom to be human . . . just like you.





we waste money .. turn on tv, gaming console, drink alcohol


Ask yourself if what youíre doing today is getting you closer to where you want to be tomorrow.


WHY YOU DON‚ÄôT HAVE WHAT YOU WANT


"I did a lot of thinking on, why did this happen?" Rousey said. "I do believe all the best things come from the worst things. The worst things result in the absolute best things. I was trying to think, what is the reason for this and what my actual purpose is -- and maybe just winning all the time isn't what's best for everybody.

If you want to lose weight, then change your lifestyle. Forget diets, bootcamps, and other temporary strategies. Weight gain is nothing more than a side effect of how you live your life. Change that, and it will go away. 

It‚Äôs tough to take responsibility for our lives and the way we live without blaming it on outside forces (i.e. the economy, other people, how we were raised).  Because when it‚Äôs 100% our responsibility, falling flat on our butts and failing is also ours to own.

So instead we often blame outside forces, because then it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot our fault‚Äù when things don‚Äôt work out.

But make no mistake, the very first step in getting everything you want, is realizing the only reason you don‚Äôt have it is yourself.

No one else in the world can stop you, but yourself (and your limited thinking).

Your entire life is your fault.

If you want to see the only thing in your way, just look in the mirror.

IF YOUR LIFE IS AWESOME, IT‚ÄôS YOUR FAULT.  IF YOUR LIFE SUCKS, IT‚ÄôS YOUR FAULT

There‚Äôs incredible power (and freedom) to be harnessed when you realize EVERYTHING in your life is your responsibility.

Your current lifestyle, body, relationships, etc. are simply a receipt printout of everything you‚Äôve done up until this point.  And if you want to change it, you‚Äôre going to have to realize first that you‚Äôre the only one who possibly can.  Stop waiting on someone else to rescue you.


Every time someone asks me, ‚ÄúHow do you live the way you do?‚Äù I answer:

‚ÄúI decided a few years ago that if I wanted to write a story worth reading when I got old, I‚Äôd have to be the one who took responsibility for creating it.‚Äù

So, now I ask for helicopter tours of the city instead of big fat cash bonuses.  I wake up at 4:30AM on Saturday mornings to do EMS ride-a-longs to learn more about the world around me, and I hit the race car track to celebrate turning a year older instead of bar hopping for my birthday.


I remind myself the only thing that will ever stop me is myself.

Science can‚Äôt (always) stop me.
Where I grew up can‚Äôt stop me.
Other people and their beliefs about what is possible can‚Äôt stop me.
And they can‚Äôt stop YOU either.

More often than not‚Ä¶ If your life is awesome, it‚Äôs your fault.  If your life sucks, it‚Äôs your fault.

I promise you can have almost anything you want in life, but the first person you‚Äôre going to have to convince is yourself.

Go get whatcha want my friends.
