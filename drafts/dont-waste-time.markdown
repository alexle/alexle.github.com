You need to question every single moment
Every moment is an absolute. So questioning it matters. You have to ask yourself, does the way I’m choosing to spend this moment align with what I really want, or is it based purely on my impulses or wants?

Do you know that feeling when you wake up, jump out of bed to start your day, and suddenly have zero time left? Not a spare moment to spend? Not even a second?

It’s devestating to have that realization that your day is done. Another 24 hour cycle has come to an end, and you’ve got nothing. You can’t even point to a positive outcome.

This is what happens when you don’t use your time mindfully. When you don’t have a clear hold on what is going on throughout the day, from the actions you take to the ones you don’t take.

I think that when you use your time mindfully, you can drag yourself away from desperate waste of time and that lack of conscious recognition of where you’re spending — and I do mean spending — your seconds.
