Thinking like an older person is thinking about resilience and focusing on what is as opposed to what is not. Accepting your mortality by not being so afraid of it. When you are older, you view the time horizons in front of you differently. You understand the days are finite, and we might as well enjoy the ones we have left. The big lesson for me, the really practical one, is waking up in the morning and saying, “Thank God for another day.” It’s the conscious practice of gratitude.







2. Think About Your Death — and Everyone Else’s — Often
“Every third thought shall be my grave.” -Prospero, The Tempest
You are closer to your death than you think.

That’s a good thing.

Let’s imagine two fathers. One consistently (not obsessively, but occasionally) thinks of his young daughter’s potential death. The second father never has such thoughts.

The first father would undoubtedly be horrified and broken at the thought of his loved one dying. The thought is powerful and haunting.

As such, it would be natural for him to respond by valuing his daughter’s time more. He would likely become more focused on her while they’re spending quality time together. Their relationship would likely become deeper, more intimate, and more full.

The second dad never thinks about his daughter passing away.

Like so many fathers, he will probably begin to take his daughter for granted. For him, the time he spends with her might just be yet another hour in the monotony of life. He might not even turn his head from the T.V. when she walks in from school.

When you think about your or a loved one’s eventual death, life’s minutiae evaporates away. Your boss doesn’t matter. Your credit score doesn’t matter. Your job doesn’t really matter. Money isn’t that important. Time slows down.

This is called “negative visualization.” Once you imagine the possibility of losing something, the things that really matter are seen with crystal clarity.

The first father might spend more quality time with his daughter in 60 minutes than the second father could in a week.

Imagine that over 10 years.

When you see life this way, time stands still. When you spend your time focusing only on what is most important, life becomes longer and fuller.

For me, contemplating my eventual death might sound morbid, but it’s not. It’s comforting. It’s invigorating. It’s revitalizing.



Every single hour of a 24-hour day is accounted for in a simple chart. It’s also not incomparably difficult to an “average person’s” schedule. He has plenty of time for free time, sleep, work, exercise, family, and fun.

For most people, hours go by like dollars in a paycheck; by the end of the month, most people can’t tell you where all their money (or time) has gone.

Just like you can make a budget for dollars to see where your money goes, you need to make a budget for your hours. This is the single easiest way to instantly create substantially more time — plan your day.

“Never begin a day until it’s written on paper.” -Jim Rohn
Here’s an example of a typical morning for me. Notice how tasks are broken down to even the 5-minute mark, and even things like brushing your teeth get a line.



You’ll wake up for about 25,000 mornings in your adult life, give or take a few. According to a report from the World Health Organization, the average life expectancy in the United States is 79 years old. (Most people in wealthy nations are hovering around the 80-year mark. Women in Japan are the highest, with an average life expectancy of 86 years.) If we use these average numbers and assume that your adult life starts at 18 years old, then you’ve got about 68 years (86-18 = 68) as an adult—a little more if you’re lucky. (68 years as an adult) x (365 days each year) = 24,820 days. 25,000 mornings.

That’s what you get in your adult life. 25,000 times you get to open your eyes, face the day, and decide what to do next. I don’t know about you, but I’ve let a lot of those mornings slip by. Once I realized this, I started thinking about how I could develop a better morning routine. I still have a lot to learn, but here are some strategies that you can use to get the most out of your 25,000 mornings.





Not to get too morbid, but we’re all going to die. Some of us sooner than expected, as this piece by Emily Maloney in The Billfold reminds us. 

Writing about the unexpected loss of a family member, Maloney explains why she has become a “now” person. A person who does things, rather than talks and dreams about them.

Recently, we lost a member of our extended family unexpectedly. She was there, and then she wasn’t. Now she is gone, and we are trying to figure out what to do next. We thought we had more time with her. Suddenly, inexplicably, I have become a now person. I want to do everything I need to do right away; I am not about to wait ten minutes to complete a task. I used to walk by the garbage three or four or twelve times before thinking, hmm, I should probably take that out. No more. Now I walk past it, see what I need to do, put on my shoes, and march it out to the receptacle on the side of our apartment building. Need to buy a stamp? Off I truck to the Post Office. Maybe it feels wrong or weird to think about mortality in this way, but there is something about losing a member of your extended family to make you think, huh, maybe I should sign up for e-billing just in case I pass away too.﻿ 

Maloney goes on to say that being a “doer” helps with her grief—personal, yes, but political, circumstantial, etc. Individuals may not be able to help stem the ravages of climate change, but they can, as she writes, mail the thing they’ve needed to mail. “Think of it as Do 1 Thing, but every day, all the time, for the rest of your life,” she writes. “Make all your resolutions immediate. Maybe you just want to resolve to make more coffee at home. Make coffee now.”


This sort of thinking doesn’t necessarily need to relate to a New Year’s resolution, though that time of year is almost upon us. It’s more along the lines of the “no more zero days” line of thinking: Do one thing each day, no matter how small, toward a goal or desire. Write one paragraph, do one pushup, read one page of a classic before bed. Take one step toward making the things you want to happen happen.

And more simplistically, it means to stop putting off the things you need to do and just do them already. “Make sure you have a will,” Maloney writes. “Make sure you have explained what you want to happen when you die. Is your 401(k) beneficiary your ex or your deadbeat brother? Change it now.”

Don’t overthink things; remember, not Don’t overthink things; remember, not everything needs to be optimized. Don’t get weighed down by idea debt. Try to just do instead. “You might surprise yourself,” writes Maloney.






Takeaway: The average life expectancy in the US is 79.3 years, but if you subtract from that time the tasks we are obligated to do, such as sleep and work, we can be left with as few as 17.5 years.

In the US, the average life expectancy is 79.3 years (76.9 years for men and 81.6 years for women). This is a decent amount of time, but I’d argue this number doesn’t give us the complete picture.

According to the most recent American Time Use Survey, here’s how the average employed person spends each day:

7.8 hours sleeping
8.8 hours working
1.8 hours on household activities
1.0 hours eating and drinking
1.2 hours caring for others
1.5 hours on “‘Other
At the end of the day, this leaves just 2.6 hours to spend how we choose.

Let’s look at these numbers from a slightly different vantage point.

While our life expectancy is 79.3 years, when we spend an average 7.8 hours of each day sleeping, that adds up to a cumulative 25.8 years of our life. Put this way, our life expectancy is now down to 53.5 years.

Let’s assume we consider a few items on this list to be inconveniences—work, household chores, and maybe even eating and drinking. Maybe you dread these commitments, or rush through them to get on with your day. Over the course of your life you’ll spend 6.9 years doing chores and chowing down food, and 29.1 years working. When you subtract these from our average life span, our life expectancy is now down to just 17.5 years.

To quote author Annie Dillard (again), how we spend our days is how we spend our lives. Whenever we simply go through the motions, or live without intention, we’re not spending our time how we truly want, or fully enjoying where we’re at.

Here’s another fun thought experiment. Imagine that instead of living your life one day at a time, you lived it sequentially: first spending 26 years hibernating sleeping, then 4 years cleaning your house, 3 years eating and drinking, 29 years working, and finally, 4 years with friends and family. Would you be happy with how you spent your life? Would you want more family time, or wish you had found your dream job sooner?

We can get even a bit more granular. Maybe if you were to live this way, you’d spend 3 years working out at the gym, followed by 5 years daydreaming, 3 years struggling to get out of bed in the morning, 1 year hungover, 4 years on Facebook, and then half a year meditating. Would you wish anything had been different?

These are just thought experiments, but they’re helpful exercises that let us question whether we’re spending our time how we want.

There are a few points to take away here:

How we spend our days is how we spend our lives. Thirty minutes of wasted time every day adds up. Time is the most valuable resource we have—we can increase our energy levels and earn more money, but time is finite.
Enjoy the moment! Impatience wishes away time. When you rearrange the blocks of your life, you may have less time than you think. Enjoy it! This is why I love meditation and mindfulness—both practices anchor you to the present moment, and let you appreciate events as they unfold.
Spend your time as you like. This advice is cliché, but it’s still something to consider. If you held the total time spent on a daily task across the balance of your life, would you be happy with how you spent those hours? Would you regret doing too much of anything, or not enough of something else?
The average person gets 79.3 years to live their life. Given that time is the most limited resource we have, it’s critical that we spend our limited hours purposefully, and doing what we enjoy.


“Don’t be afraid of death; be afraid of an unlived life. You don’t have to live forever; you just have to live.” ~Natalie Babitt

Once a month, I visit the local cemetery and walk around. I’m not there to visit anyone in particular. I’m there to remind myself of my own mortality.

And it always wakes me up.

I soak in the energy: I read the simple legacies on the tombstones, from young children to those who made it to 100 years old. I’m not morose. I’m not negative. I’ve simply found the greatest motivational tool in the world, and I assure you it’s not quotes on Instagram or Pinterest. It’s not the latest YouTube clip.

It’s one thing and one thing only: remembering we are all going to die soon


How Many Summers Do You Have Left?
Seneca was a roman philosopher who lived 2000 years ago and a leader of the stoic movement. One of his essays, entitled On the Shortness of Life provides a reminder to all of us: our time here is nearly over.

And yet what Seneca argues, and does so brilliantly, is that life isn’t really short. The problem is how we waste so much of our lives on things that don’t matter: wondering what others think, getting caught up in gossip, wasting our lives on social media and the non-essential.

When this happens, it’s no wonder we lack clarity and meaning in our lives. It’s no wonder we feel overwhelmed, overworked, and overstimulated on a daily basis. When we’re in this place, we don’t have the time or energy to think about death.

And yet, our time is running out. I like to think of it this way:

How many more summers do we have left? How many early June mornings with the sun barely making its presence known as we sip coffee do we have left? How many moments with our kids, family, and those who we love do we have left? How many times do we get to do what we love for yet another day?

We don’t know the answer to this, but I do know one thing: it’s much closer than we think, and every day is a gift. Let’s examine why remembering our own mortality is the best way to start living and how you can use it as leverage to live boldly today.

Ask the Tough Questions
Reminding ourselves of our mortality invites us to ask the tough questions from our lives. These are the questions we often avoid, yet are always running in the background:

Who am I?

Why am I here?

Is this life for me?

Am I on my own path, or someone else’s?

Because they’re uncomfortable, they become easy to avoid through busyness, noise, and the endless demands of a 24/7 digital culture. Usually we don’t take any time to face these questions unless someone close to us experiences a crisis (or we do, too).

But within these questions lie powerful answers. They allow us to get honest with ourselves instead of giving in to the usual mental chatter we so often believe. By asking the tough questions, we start to achieve clarity around what matters… and we start discarding what doesn’t.


The Power of Urgency
Have you ever had a project due in three months, yet put it off until the last minute and somehow got it all done? We all have. This is the power of urgency, deadlines, and accountability: We get clear, focused, and set boundaries to ensure we finish.

But how often do we do the same with our own lives? Most people don’t operate with any sense of urgency in life; there’s always tomorrow, next week, or next year.

Until there’s not. The beauty of reminding ourselves our time is limited means we’re operating with high levels of urgency, knowing every day truly matters.

When this happens, we say no to the things we should. We tell people how we really feel. And we overcome the resistance on our dreams, the self-doubt, and uncertainty. We feel those yet move forward anyway.

Because the pain of regret hurts more than putting ourselves out there. When this happens, we start to trust ourselves and recognize our dreams are worth it. Best of all: we’re worth bringing them to life.

Integrating This into Your Life 
Steve Jobs, in his riveting Stanford commencement speech, said it better than I ever could:

“Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”

So, how do we use our mortality to make bold decisions and start to live our dreams today? You don’t have to be as extreme as I am with visiting your local cemetery, although I’d recommend it.

Here are some of my favorite ways:

Journal about your legacy.
Take yourself twenty, thirty, or forty years down the line. How do you want to be remembered? Write it all down.


Remind yourself of death once a day.
Every day take a moment and anchor yourself in the beautiful gift we all have. With this energy, ask yourself: What is one bold step I can take today?

It’s your time now.

Embrace your mortality, make the decision you’ve been putting off, and never look back.
