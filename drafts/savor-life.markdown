Slow down. Calm down. Don’t worry. Don’t hurry. Trust the process.” ~Alexandra Stoddard

 Heard in the offices across America…

“I’m so busy and have no time!”

“How is it almost 2019 already?!”

“I’ll sleep when I’m dead…”

We’re so focused on the next deadline, getting the next promotion, having the approval of our managers and peers alike that we push, push, push all the time.



How was your day yesterday or the day before that? Do you remember what happened; how you felt, who you spent time with, what you saw, heard, tasted, or experienced? Do you remembered what moved you to tears or laughter? It wasn’t long ago that I didn’t remember any of those things unless I looked at my calendar or my to-do list. Every day felt like a race against the clock and a quest to see how much I could cram in and get through. After a while though, I realized I wanted more than to just get through my life. I wanted to show up for it, to be in my life and not just checking pieces of it off my list each day.





Sometimes we find ourselves on autopilot. Life settles into a predictable routine and we roll with it. The alarm goes off, we hit the shower, dress and face the day. Just like we did the day before.

There’s nothing wrong with routines. In fact, I’m a big fan of routines and habits, because that’s how we achieve our goals and objectives. But how do we know if the goals and objectives we adopted still stand? The answer?

Personal reflection

Our hearts and minds have a funny way of getting our attention. Sometimes, they hit like a brick between the eyes. Other times, they emerge like a subtle but persistent restlessness. Either way, we know when something feels amiss.

“Time flies over us, but leaves its shadow behind.” — Nathaniel Hawthorne

If you want to invite more reflection into your life, you need to push back against the cult of busyness. Modern life is awash in technical advances, but somehow our smartphones and non-stop texting have edged out the stillness.

People’s faces are immersed in the glow of their devices everywhere. People waiting in line (at Starbucks, the doctor’s office, the post office, etc.) have their phones out. You feel dumb if you don’t pull your phone out, too.


When we ask friends and associates how they are, they usually say, “Busy. I’ve got a lot going on.” We view “busy” as a sign of success or importance. Except it’s not. It’s more a sign that we’ve lost some balance.

We’ve forgotten how to connect with others. How to slow down and appreciate the real texture of our lives. Not the digital landscape, but the real one. Most of all, we’ve forgotten how to reflect more on our lives.

Check out this short, moving video about the importance of slowing down.

You need to do this more in your life. You need to find quiet places. Turn off your devices. Breathe deeply. And then spend some time reflecting.

Let the thoughts roam around a bit, freely, in your mind. If you haven’t done this in a long time, be patient. You might feel like you’re wasting time, but you’re not. Just as a vacation from work can recharge your batteries, quiet reflection can recharge your mind and spirit.

Embrace personal reflection more in your life. Watch how it slowly heals your weary mind. Feel how it stokes the embers of past dreams, and reveals who you really are, or want to become.

Google and social media can wait. The deeper meaning of your life is calling, and personal reflection is the lifeline to help you reconnect.





As a former Type A person, I firmly believe that most Type A types are failing at life. They’ve opted for an utterly miserable existence, working in unrewarding jobs that make them unhappy and stressed and take them away from their loved ones. A Type A life is largely without leisurely novels, adventurous travels, or hours at the pub with friends—and all because pleasure has been rejected as a worthwhile goal.

“If you think about modern stresses and desires about status and consumerism, there’s a lot of that we might be able to do without and probably would be healthy for us to do without,” says Warren. “A lot of people work too hard because they think they need a salary increase and they think they need a salary increase because they need a new iPhone and that sort of thing.”

It’s easy to fall into false beliefs about what matters, based on the expectations of those around us. Hedonistic philosophy helps to puncture those views and reminds us what’s truly valuable. True pleasure, far from being frivolous, is the ultimate indication of a life well lived.


Sure, life will throw you curveballs almost religiously, but whether you choose to swing the bat or walk back to the bench is entirely up to you. Life isn’t supposed to be entirely pleasant – it never will be, for anyone ever. You will always find yourself pushing ahead against resistance and that will never change. If it feels like things get easier as you get older, it’s only because you aren’t pushing as hard as you used to.



What gives life meaning is the struggle that we live through.
I know it may seem silly at the moment, but consider how your life would be if you never had to struggle with anything, ever. Imagine if everything you wanted would just fall at your feet – you never have to work hard for anything in your life. It seems like a dream come true. Until you realize how incredibly boring such a life really is.

As human beings, we need to feel challenged. We need to feel that we have accomplished something and the only way to feel as if you have accomplished something is by having to struggle in order to get there. Without struggle, life wouldn’t be worth living.

You’ll one day look back at your life and look back at all your struggles with a smile. Some you surely overcame and others you likely didn’t, but you’re smiling because you’re still alive and breathing. You’re stronger than you know.


No matter how good or bad you think you have it, wake up each day thankful for your life.  Someone somewhere else is desperately fighting for theirs.  Instead of thinking about what youøre missing, think about what you have that everyone else is missing.  Think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive in your own shoes ø to breathe a fresh breath, to think another thought, to enjoy a new moment, to have options ø then go out and make the day count.


As I write this now I am very grateful for many things. For my four children, good health, a loyal partner, wonderful friends and being able to do work I love.  I am also grateful for the times when life has been hard, when my heart has ached, when Iøve wrestled with despair and longed for certainty. I know those dark days have sewn new depth into the tapestry of my life, and brought invaluable opportunities to learn and grow in my own humanity. And I know that, over the years ahead, more will surely follow. While I donøt look forward to them, I know that by practicing gratitude daily, it will help me rise above them and ultimately emerge through them more whole, not less so.

Of course, living in a permanent state of gratitude is a tough ask for anyone. As human beings we all succumb to the temptation of comparing and complaining and focusing on whatøs wrong over whatøs right. Living in gratitude entails an ongoing exercise of accepting us ourselves as the imperfect yet magnificent øhuman becomingsø that we are. So instead of berating yourself for sometimes taking things (your kids, your home, your freedom, your friends) for granted, instead forgive yourself for being human, take a long deep grateful breath, and commit to radiating gratitude with, and for, those around youø. whoever they are (however maddening they sometimes are!)  After all, feeling gratitude without spreading it is like preparing a magnificent Thanksgiving feast without sharing it ø something my dad would never do!


Gratitude is an antidote to lifeøs hardships and an magnifier of its blessings. We must practice it not just at Thanksgiving, or just when life is easy. We must practice it always.





Good to Be Home

At the end of it all though, I realized how much travel helps you appreciate home.

Our trip was incredible and it was one of the things I was looking forward to most when I thought about leaving my full-time job but after over 3 months of being on the road, I was ready to get home again.

It’s funny how you appreciate small things about ordinary life when you get back. We’ve been home for nearly two months and I still get a lot of joy out of getting a nice cold glass of water to drink directly out of the tap!

Another reason I’m happy to be back is because it’s hard to be productive when you’re constantly sightseeing, figuring out where to eat next, looking for flights, etc. so I didn’t get much done when I was travelling.

I’ve realized that I get a lot of happiness by making progress on projects that are interesting and important to me and I’m able to get more done when I’m in a routine so I’ve come to accept that perpetual travel is not on the cards for us.

Trips like the one we just completed are fantastic though so although we’re not going to be full-time nomads, I look forward to planning our next big trip soon.




They find joy in the process of getting there. Let go of the results.

 Enjoy the things you have
The problem of many people is that they think they’ll become happy when they get to the certain point in life, for example, if they will get promoted, get married or buy a new house. These things take time and the truth is that when you have them, you think of new things you cannot be happy without. Thus, you’ll work your whole life to achieve something and eventually won’t enjoy any of it. Learn how to relax and to be happy about the things you already have.

ìEverything that shine ainít always gonna be gold,î Kid Cudi raps in Pursuit of Happiness. Science has his back: Itís a well-established fact that something that made you happy will have a less euphoric effect over time. In other words, you get used to stuff. In scientific circles, the phenomenon is called hedonic adaptation.

Whatís the remedy? A new study in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin shows that appreciation and variety ward off hedonic adaptation to keep you happy longer.

In the study, researchers asked 481 students to answer questions about their well-being. Six weeks later they were asked to identify a recent positive life change. At the end of the 12th week, they were asked to say how that positive change was affecting them. (Speaking of positive changeóare you ready to make one? Pick up your copy of the Testosterone Advantage Plan to have better sex and build bigger muscles!)

ìOverall, people were appreciating it less, interacting with it less, and wanting more of it,î says study author Kennon M. Sheldon, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of Missouri.

A handful of subjects, however, reported they still appreciated the positive change. What made them different? They had been varying their experiences with the things that made them happy. Say you started a new job. Youíd appreciate it for longer if you met new coworkers, took on new challenges, and learned new skills, the study suggests.

How come? Novelty protects us from taking things for granted, the researchers explain. Varying experiences gives you new surprises, which keeps providing noticeable positive experiences. Hereís how to put the findings into action.


For instance, studies show that the owners of luxury cars are generally no happier driving them than the owners of compacts, and that owning a vacation home has no impact on happiness. "This process of hedonic adaptation sets in. We start taking for granted almost any change in our lives," says Sonja Lyubomirsky, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of California at Riverside. When it comes to satisfaction, she says, you'd do far better buying an experience. "We are the sum total of our experiences," Lyubomirsky says. "People don't define themselves so much in terms of their possessions." One University of Texas study found that compared with material purchases, experiential purchases made materialists just as happy.

Instead of purchasing the Mercedes or the Porsche, rent one for a weekendóand drive it hard. Better yet, skip the Porsche and take your nephew to the go-kart track and shred the asphalt all day long for a fraction of the cost. As for the vacation homeówell, it may be fun to think about, but that's because you're not dealing with the flooded basement, the noisy neighbors, and the monthly payments. As with the Porsche, you're better off rentingónot least because you can vacation somewhere new every year and put the money you saved toward, say, guitar lessons. Or perhaps a class in Italian and two tickets to Italy. You might try Puglia, the heel of the boot, where you can still spend a few weeks sipping Primitivo on the Adriatic for the price of some designer shirts. But whatever you do: Don't buy a boat!

While it's generally true that a nice car won't make you happy, there is one exception: when you're actually thinking about the car. The same is true of any decent bottle of wine: Savoring it will bring you more pleasure. 

In other words, they'd become snobs.

To win back your happiness, learn how to savor again. : The secret to savoring is breaking pleasurable experiences into smaller chunks. "You reduce adaptation and increase sensitivity," I'd also suggest that instead of buying one big thing, make little purchases over time to repeat that initial enjoyment effect," says Meyvis. Ultimately, savoring is a cognitive tool that's as important as positive thinking or goal setting. It's how you transform products into experiences: anticipating them, engaging them, making them memorable. And insulating them from the numbing effects of money.

If you're not buying experiences, at least spend your money on stuff that can easily convert into experiences. Choose things you can interact with, or things that lead to interaction with others. Food is always a good bet for this reason. If you must have a fancy cooking toy, spend your money on bricks and build a pizza oven in your yard. You'll remember the experience and enjoy reconnecting with old friends. Also, stick to smaller portions of high-quality goods. "The bigger your portions," says Meyvis, "the more you consume, the greater your adaptation, and the less you'll savor." Then learn to enjoy the humble purchases. Don't let your taste for fine wine prevent you from relishing a cold can of Miller on a hot day. If all else fails, reset. "We call it 'revirginizing,'" says Jordi Quoidbach, Ph.D., the lead author of the chocolate study. Depriving yourself of day-to-day pleasures restores your ability to enjoy them. Go camping, or swear off coffee for a weekóand then blow your mind on a double espresso at home.


When we begin to understand that relationships are not always meant to last, we can also have a deeper appreciation for the experiences we share with people while they are in our lives. Though it may sadden you to consider the end of a relationship, you can begin to appreciate the people in your life for the sheer reason that they exist in your present. People come and go, but memories last forever.

The lessons people teach us and the hardships they help us navigate are never forgotten. These memories become permanent parts of us and continue to shape who we become. Just because a relationship does not last does not mean that it is insignificant in any way. It is not the amount of time these relationships last that is important, but instead, it is the ability to remember them.

Once we can accept the realization that relationships are fleeting, our lives will be filled with vast moments of appreciation. Appreciation for each relationship in its entirety and the uniqueness of the moments that you share together ø appreciation for the present.

Leaving people behind is never easy ø it never feels right to move on to the next chapter. But, as life continues onward, so do we, and just because we leave people, it does not mean we must forget the times we shared. It does not mean that all those things must be lost in some unknown abyss. All we can ask is to remember and that those whom we once loved remember us, too.


Donít wait to retire to see the world. Take vacations. Downgrade your life. Cut your expenses to get out and see these things. The views are free, you just have to get your ass there. You wonít regret it or forget it.
