Travel often feels a bit empty
Far from an achievement or enlightenment, it’s often more indulgent and fun — and, sure, perhaps you learn a thing or two and become a little less narrow-minded. But money aside, it is truly one of the easiest things in the world to do — you simply make it a priority, book the tickets, and go. And then, you’re just kind of… there.

We sweep into these places as though they’re check-boxes, as though the answer to our lives will be found in the bottom of un café au lait in France, the fish markets of Thailand, or anywhere in between. As though spending 2 nights and 3 days anywhere will mean anything to us other than coming back to report: it was lovely.

And it is.

But also: what difference does it all make?

Every time I travel, I can’t help but think “but what is the point of this?”

I like cultures — and I like new experience. As I said. I’ll “play the game” when I travel, eating the local foods and drinking the local drinks and speaking, best I can, in the local language. And I enjoy this, but I don’t really get it — not in the way that it’s sold. I know that travel is supposed to be life-changing and perspective-broadening but, over the course of just a few days, frankly, I don’t think it really can be. (Unless, of course, our “perspective” is regarding “the best cheese we’ve ever had;” our “broadening” of it dependent on — and always locked away in — our mental categorization after the fact.)

But other than that, I’m not sure I get it. And if what you’re looking for is “something new” or even open-mindedness, it can be done much more cheaply and closer to home.

And I like relaxation, too — sure — but, similarly, you can do so without using a passport.

And so it leaves me with these questions of “why though?” Is it truly to check boxes? I have a hard time believing it isn’t. Is it the satisfaction of just knowing we can? Sure — there’s no shame in that. Or maybe most people don’t look to travel for any of this. I have a hard time believing that, but even if it is true, I have an even harder time doing it myself.


But most of all, I’m tired of the things most digital nomads won’t tell you beyond those videos of them scuba diving in the Maldives or zip lining through the Costa Rican jungle.

Why? Because so many of them are doing a damn good job hiding the fact that they’re not as happy or fulfilled as people think they are. That being a digital nomad doesn’t change you fundamentally. It’s your life … but over there. And when you get back (and you will), your problems don’t go anywhere.
