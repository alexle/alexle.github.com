You Need Less Than You Think
12-25-2013



I choose to eliminate distractions.

Iíve engineered my life to be incredibly minimalist. I donít own a home. I donít own a car. I donít have any major recurring expenses. I wear the same thing every day. I eat the same thing. My life is extremely simple. Thatís the way Iíve designed it.

The more things I add into my life -- possessions, stuff, variety, etc. -- the more distracted I become. I canít focus on the most important things, which for me are my businesses and my relationships.

A personal vehicle falls into the category of ìdistracting.î I donít want the extra payments, hassle, repairs, maintenance, upkeep and worry of owning it. And most of all, I donít want the distraction of wanting to speed around the racetrack instead of working. Besides, I donít need it, because I have Uber or other options for transportation.

Car ownership is one more thing I got rid of in order to give me greater energy and focus on what truly fulfills me.



When Barry gives me advice, I listen. He told me one time, ìWhen you get older, you realize whatís really important -- itís family, relationships . . . itís not about being 'cool.' Your car is going to get dinged up. Itís just a car. Itís a headache. Get something cheap! I used to drive a Ferrari when I was young, and now I drive a Toyota Camry. If I had to do it all over again, I would have never bought the Ferrari. Itís a waste!î

So, let me say again: For some people, cars are important. And thatís fine.

For me, the reason I donít own a car is simple: I choose to focus my energy, passion and money on things that truly matter to me. For me, thatís family and friends.


Enjoy simple things. There is already enough in front of us, right now, that we donít need more. We can go for a walk, sit and read a book, do some pushups or yoga, sketch or write or play some music, have a conversation with someone, or do nothing and see what thatís like. We can walk barefoot on grass, drink a cup of tea, create something new, learn about something new, be curious about the life thatís in front of us. This is delightful, without needing to buy more or get more.
Finally, recognize that itís an ongoing practice. In my experience, you donít just get rid of desires and then youíre done. You let go of one, turn to the present moment, appreciate it, find satisfaction in what there already is Ö and then a little while later, another desire arises. It comes from advertising, websites, magazines, seeing what other people are doing on social media, watching the news, talking to people, walking past a cool store, seeing a new bag that your friend just bought, etc.

The desires will keep coming back, but we can develop the skill of recognizing them, letting them go, being happy with the enough-ness of now.





The idea of reducing everything you have and need to a minimum amount has fascinated me for years now.




Being a conscious consumer basically means being frugal. As Ramit Sethi puts it:

Frugality, quite simply, is about choosing the things you love enough to spend extravagantly on—and then cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don't love.
Aaa
You can never, ever get enough of what you do NOT need to make you happy.  Think about it.  Itís nice to have money and the things that money can buy, but itís also important to make sure you havenít lost track of the priceless things money canít buy.  You donít need a lot of money to lead a rich life.  Good friends and a loving family are worth their weight in gold.  It really is the little things that mean the mostÖ like a long hug at just the right time.

Instead of focusing so intently on what you want to get, consider the things you can let go of.  Eliminate some excess baggage, lighten your load and feel a weight lifted.  So many of the things you think you need you do not need at all, you simply want them.  And as your wants diminish, your freedom and abundance grow.  Challenge your impulses, and free yourself of needless needs.

I need my ___. Fill in the blank: I need my coffee, my cheese, my soda, my TV shows, my car, my shoe collection … these are things we convince ourselves we can’t live without, so we can’t make a change like becoming vegan or eating healthier or unschooling our kids or simplifying our lives or going car-free. And I’ve made these excuses myself, but they all turned out to be lies. I didn’t need any of that. The only things you really need are basic food, water, clothing, shelter, and other people for social needs. Everything else is not a real need.


Most Americans, for example, are deep in unnecessary debt, overweight and poorly nourished, inactive and stressed out, and self-sentenced to a mandatory career of unsatisfying work just to stay afloat. We constantly buy things we can’t afford and don’t need, and the majority of the trading we do does not increase our net happiness. 


* Youíll no longer complain about having a shitty bike, or a crappy car.

* Youíll no longer complain or be embarrassed about riding the bus.

* Youíll cherish what you have longer.

* Youíll stop whining about long work hours as itís unlikely that no matter how hard these kids try, they will never be as fortunate as you.

* Youíll think twice about gorging yourself with so much food at one meal that might somewhere else feed a family of five.

* Youíll naturally be much fitter because youíll be more mindful of how little other people have to eat.

* Youíll stop wasting money on stupid crap, which after a short period of time youíll no longer use.

* Youíll try harder to make the most of your situation because youíll be reminded that not everybody is as lucky as you.

* Youíll stop thinking that everybody else is privileged and lucky because youíre already so much luckier than so many other people already.

* Youíll begin to focus on how you can better yourself, rather than try and bring someone else down to your level.

* Youíll empathize more with people who are less fortunate.

Spend less than you earn. Everyone says it, then most people ignore it. The secret is to want very little. Be satisfied with few possessions, simple food, not needing the newest everything or the coolest restaurants or entertainment. Find a library, read some free books, work on some skills, eat simple vegan food. Save as much as you can. Yes, you’re young and not worried about retirement, but having money when you’re old isn’t the point — the point is to build an emergency fund so you aren’t scared about making rent.
