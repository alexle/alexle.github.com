Third Important Life Skill: How to Act Without Knowing the Result
Throughout most of our lives, almost everything has a clear result attached to it. In school, you write your term paper because that’s what your teacher told you to do. At home, you clean your room because that’s what your parents reward you for. At work, you do what your boss says because that gets you paid.

There’s no uncertainty. You just act.

Teacher wants a paper. So you write it. Mom wants a clean room. So you clean it.

But most of life — that is, real life — doesn’t work this way. When you decide to change careers, there’s no one there telling you which career is right for you. When you decide to commit to someone, there’s no one telling you this relationship is going to make you happy. When you decide to start a business or move to a new country or eat waffles instead of pancakes for breakfast, there’s no way of knowing — for certain — if what you’re doing is “right” or not.

And so we avoid it. We avoid making these decisions. We avoid moving and acting without knowing. And because we cannot act on what we don’t know, our lives become incredibly repetitive and safe.

I get a lot of emails from people asking me how to find their life’s purpose. Or how to know if they’re in the right relationship or not. Or how to know if they’re making the right change.

And I don’t reply to those people because I have no fucking idea.

For one, no one else can decide what’s right for your life but you. But secondly, the fact that you’re asking some guy on the internet (or looking for it in a book or something) is itself part of the problem — you are looking to know the result before acting.

There’s a great scene in The Dark Knight where the Joker shares his life’s philosophy:

“I just do things.”

Now, for all of Joker’s flaws (terrorist, mass murderer, armed robber, political assassin — but we’ll overlook that for now), he does have a point here.

“Schemers trying to control their little worlds…”

The fact is: sometimes you just have to do things for no other reason than to do them. Do them because you can. Because they exist. As George Mallory said when asked why he wanted to climb Mt. Everest: “Because it’s there.”

Add some chaos to your life. A certain amount is healthy. It stimulates growth and change and passion and excitement.

Developing the ability to simply do things for no other reason than curiosity or interest or hell, even boredom — the ability to do things with no expectation for result or accolade or productivity or fanfare — will train you to better make these big ambiguous life decisions. It will train you to simply start on something without knowing where in the hell it’s going.

And while this will result in a thousand tiny failures, it will also likely result in your life’s biggest successes.

You can start small. Open up meetup.com and attend something for no other reason than it looks interesting or is there. Go to Udemy or Khan Academy and sign up for a course for no other reason than it looks cool. Call up a friend or family member and tell them, “Show me something new that you think is amazing,” and go from there.

But there’s a subtle trap here, of course.

Many of you will go out and think, “Well, Dad [that’s me, remember?] said I need to start spontaneously doing stuff so that I can be able to make those big decisions in my life despite uncertainty. So let’s see, what spontaneous thing can I plan and engineer today?”

You fail.

Before you even started, you already failed. There is nothing productive about this. There is no progress here. Stop making everything you do about accomplishing some fucking goal.

Or to put it another way: Get good at wasting time in unexpected ways.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a poker game with a group of random friends and strangers to organize.





How often do you let go of what you think your life is supposed to look like, and sincerely appreciate it for everything it is?

If you’re anything like the rest of us, it’s probably not often enough.

Your life, with all its ups and downs, unexpected twists and turns, has brought you to this moment.  It took each and every intricate, confusing, and painful situation you have encountered to bring you to right here, right now.  And if you have the courage to admit that you’re a little scared, and have the ability to smile even as you cry, the nerve to ask for help when you need it, and the wisdom to take it when it’s offered, then you have everything you need.  You just have to believe it so you can take the next step.






To not compare our progress with that of others, and accept that we all need our own time to travel our own distance.
To see how many of the things we never wanted or expected, ultimately turn out to be what we need.
To be OK with not ending up exactly where we intended to go, while opening ourselves up to the possibility of eventually arriving precisely in the right place at the right time.


Amy’s just got a promotion, Jill is going to Europe for a month, and Larry just lost 20 pounds and looks so fit he could be a trainer. When you look at what is happening for your friends, do you congratulate them and feel happy for them? Or do you use their good news to feel bad about yourself? Social comparisons are a sure way for many emotionally sensitive people to judge themselves negatively and be in a funk. 

Your life is unique. What you treasure, value, and what makes you happy is about you, not about anyone else. Comparing yourself to others is not a guide for how you are doing in living your life the way you want to. Have you found yourself envying someone for something you don’t even want?

You also don’t really know what someone else’s life is really like. Have you ever envied others for their new homes and cars and later learned they were bankrupt or so far in debt they couldn’t pay their bills?

When you compare yourself to others, you are probably comparing your weaknesses to their strengths. That’s a perfect way to drop your self-esteem. Even if you compare your strengths to theirs, there will always be some people who have it better or have accomplished more than you and those who have accomplished less. Where you rank has nothing to do with how you want to live your life.  Social comparisons build resentments. Instead of cheering on your fellow human beings you are competing and perhaps wishing them ill. It’s so easy to lose focus on having fun and enjoying yourself. Unhealthy comparisons can lead you to focus only on who is the best. That can destroy the joy and fun of the experience.Just because someone can climb a mountain faster than I can doesn’t mean I won’t still have a great time.

To stop social comparisons, the first step is to be aware. Notice when you are doing it. Sometimes you can notice and let it go. If not, change your focus. Instead of, “He’s so much stronger than I am,” compare yourself to yourself. “I am stronger than I was last month.” Or you can use it to notice what you want to do. “I am going to work on getting stronger because that is a value for me.”

When you find yourself noticing what others have that you don’t, be sure to remember what you do have. Practicing gratitudes helps you remember all you have to be grateful for.





Never assume that you are stuck with the way things are right now.  Life changes every single second, and so can you. – When hard times hit there’s a tendency to extrapolate and assume the future holds more of the same.  For some strange reason this doesn’t happen as much when things are going well.  A laugh, a smile, and a warm fuzzy feeling are fleeting and we know it.  We take the good times at face value in the moment for all they’re worth and then we let them go.  But when we’re depressed, struggling, or fearful, it’s easy to heap on more pain by assuming tomorrow will be exactly like today.  This is a cyclical, self-fulfilling prophecy.  If you don’t allow yourself to move past what happened, what was said, what was felt, you will look at your future through that same dirty lens, and nothing will be able to focus your foggy judgment.  You will keep on justifying, reliving, and fueling a perception that is worn out and false.



Afterthoughts… On Life’s Twists and Turns

Does the walker choose the path, or does the path choose the walker?  Believe it or not, in the end quite often it’s the latter.

In fact, that’s one of the most valuable aspects of the strategies discussed above – by focusing inward, dropping excess baggage, letting go of the uncontrollable, building sustainable daily rituals, and appreciating what’s going well, you give yourself the perspective and momentum needed to cope with the unexpected twists and turns on the path in front of you.  And yes, oftentimes the immediate path chooses you, not the other way around.  And that’s not a bad thing either.

Some of the greatest outcomes that transpire in your life will be the ones you never even knew you wanted.  As long as you keep your mind open to new perspectives and yourself moving forward, there really are no wrong turns in life, only paths you didn’t know you were meant to walk.  And you never can be certain what’s around the corner.  It could be everything, or it could be nothing.  You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you realize you’ve come a long way from where you started.

All details aside, someday all the pieces will come together.  Unimaginably good outcomes will likely transpire in your life, even if everything doesn’t turn out exactly the way you had anticipated.  And you will look back at the times that have passed, smile widely, and ask yourself…

“How in the world did I get through all of that?”





Life is full of twists and turns. And, sometimes those twists and turns don't lead you somewhere pleasant.


Most of us grew up drinking a lot of toxic lemonade. We were taught that successful people are people who know their direction exactly. They never waver.

They are always moving ahead, getting promoted and earning more and more money all the time.

Is that success? It depends what you want. Some people want a straight-ahead career path with clear, defined rewards. Some people want a very different life. They want to explore the world. They want to understand themselves better.

They want to see what’s possible. They don’t assume that because a career path is well-defined (by someone else!) that it’s necessarily right for them, or a good way to invest their precious time and energy.



Life rarely goes as planned.  For every person that succeeds in doing exactly what they set out to do in the exact time frame they set out to do it in, there are dozens of others who start strong and get derailed.  And if this happens to you, it isn’t a bad thing.  New obstacles and opportunities may come along to shift your perspective, to strengthen your resolve, or to change your direction for the better.  Again, the destination you fall in love with someday may not even exist today.  For example, just a few short years ago the esteemed career paths of working at Facebook, SnapChat, and Twitter didn’t exist.  Neither did the job of professional coach and blogger at Marc and Angel Hack Life.

So… if you can’t plan out your future in its entirety, what should you do?

Focus a little less on the future and focus a little more on what you can do now that will benefit you no matter what the future brings.  Read.  Write.  Learn and practice useful skills.  Test your skills and ideas.  Build things.  Be adventurous and seek real-world experiences.  Cultivate healthy relationships.  These efforts will help in any future opportunities that come your way, and they may even create them for you.

Bottom line: When life does not go as planned, breathe and remember that life’s richness often comes from its unpredictability.  Remind yourself that you are on a journey that’s ongoing, and that nothing is ever guaranteed.  Sometimes this is hard to accept.  Sometimes you have to force yourself to step forward.  Sometimes you just have to accept the fact that things will never go back to how they used to be, and that this ending is really a new beginning.



The best way to find work that you are passionate about is to do work you are good at. When you are talented at something and you find work that brings out your natural strengths, you are much more likely to develop passion in that area.
