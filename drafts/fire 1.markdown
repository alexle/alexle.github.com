Earn, Save, Invest
As you might imagine, the more you do of these three, the faster you'll get to financial independence.




places with him, would you do it?” Grant writes at the start of the second chapter. “Of course not. Why? Because time is more valuable than money.”

You can always make more money…but you can't make more time.

This is not permission to spend lavishly on anything and everything just because you might get hit by a truck tomorrow. It is, however, an invitation to consider what's important to you and to focus on that. It's encouragement to get clear on your personal mission statement and to build your life around it.





It’s just too grueling. We have to take breaks,” says Lynda Gratton, a London Business School professor and coauthor of “The 100-Year Life: Living and Working in an Age of Longevity.” “Why wouldn’t you want to take some of the retirement at the end of your life and distribute it to the middle of your life?”

The sabbatical — a chance to recharge mid-career — is hardly a new idea, and it’s still common in academia. But until recently most wouldn’t dream of quitting their jobs just to have fun for a year or two. And, as Gratton acknowledges, doing so is still a financial impossibility for the vast majority of workers.


Kyle Parrish and his wife, Kate, both in their early 30s and clients of Wealthfront, returned to San Francisco in November from a 15-month round-the-world trip. They visited 25 countries and every continent except Antarctica. They made friends, and kept costs low, by staying with locals — working on farms in Slovenia and Patagonia.

The trip cost $40,000 and required Parrish to quit a good, if intense, job in sales at Dropbox Inc., the San Francisco-based cloud storage company.

They have no regrets. “You only have one life,” he said. “As a human being, you have to stop and refresh.”

Wealthfront co-founder Dan Carroll, 36, said the attitudes of clients, particularly younger ones, have shifted: “Retirement is no longer the ultimate goal. We want to live enriched lives today rather than waiting to begin life at retirement.”

When the robo-advisor surveyed its clients, more than half listed “take time off to travel” as a top priority, listing it ahead of all other goals except “financial independence” and “early retirement.”

Taking a break to travel isn’t a crazy move, especially for millennials, because it can help give workers the stamina for longer, more sustainable careers, says Jamie Hopkins, a professor and director of the retirement income program at the American College of Financial Services.

The prospect of a future trip also gives young workers an extra reason to save, live within their means, and pay down debt — an incentive that’s far stronger than the dream of retiring in several decades’ time.

“I’m not sure we can picture what retirement is going to look like in 30 or 40 years,” Hopkins said.







1. Desire Less
Here’s some common sense: It takes more time to make money than to spend it. You work thousands of hours to make a certain amount of money. And then, you can drop it all on a new car, luxury vacation, watch, or anything else that you desire.

We all know that, right? And yet, we keep on spending money like it’s nothing. I know this is something your granddad probably said, but the easiest way to grow your bank account is NOT to spend it all.

It’s solid advice. The ancient Stoics knew about this too. True freedom means you desire less.

3. Avoid Personal Debt
Personal debt destroys your net worth like nothing else. To be clear, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with borrowing money.

If you want to start a business or do big real estate deals, it’s often necessary and smart to take on debt. But we must be wise about taking on debt. Like investing, there are rules to it.

One thing is sure: Never borrow money to buy a car, electronics, or anything else that goes down in value.

But when it comes to more complex things like growing/starting a business, investing in real estate, or even your education, think carefully before you go into debt. Remember that borrowing money is not free.

4. Save As Much As You Can
This is obvious by now. Desire less, avoid debt, and save as much as you can. Personal finance is called personal finance for a reason.

Your money strategy depends on your age, personality, place you live, education, experience, etc. A person who lives in Manhattan probably can’t buy an apartment. It’s overpriced, and renting is probably smarter.

Buying an apartment makes more sense in a city with lower real estate prices. In that case, renting is more expensive. No matter what you do, always make sure you have enough cash so you can make an investment if you spot an opportunity.

How much in savings is enough? That’s up to you. What figure makes you feel comfortable?







Most people believe that having more money will fix their money problems. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. You are not “broke” because you do not have a lot of money or because you cannot buy the things you want and need. Being broke is not a dollar amount. But it is a mindset that you, somehow, let define you. We often want more, yet we still have trouble managing the money we currently possess. How many times have you received extra money, and in days, you blew through it? Is it the money’s fault, or is it yours? We believe that having more money will fix our spending habits, when in fact; having more exposes the bad ones. Bad habits will not help you if you get more money, so it’s not the money that has to change. It is you and your belief surrounding money that must change. If you want to stop feeling broke, you cannot fix your money issues by crying about what you do not have. You fix them by appreciating what you have and focusing more on what you want.

1. You spend too much time watching people live life instead of building a wealthy one of your own.

You may find yourself spending a lot of money, but feeling broke isn’t always about how you manage money. It is also connected to how you manage your time. What do you spend most of your time doing? Are you constantly growing as a person, learning more, and reading more? Or, are you watching everyone else live their lives while neglecting your own? When you’re not working, taking care of your children, or running your business, what are you doing with your discretionary time? How much time is spent watching television? How much time do you spend on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter? Social media is a great platform used to gain insight and news, but it can also be addictive due to the entertainment factor. Being entertained is great, but being wealthy is better. Do you care more about “likes” or your financial freedom? The choice is yours.

You value spending over investing.

There is nothing wrong with spending money, but most times we are spending money on our immediate wants while neglecting our long term needs. By caving in to immediate gratification, we do not place emphasis on making our lives greater down the road. Spending money decreases your net worth. Investing money gives you the ability to increase it.

If you cannot save a dime out of a dollar, how will you ever save a million out of ten million? Start investing with what you have, even if that means starting with less than $100. If you get the opportunity to receive or make additional income, don’t just spend it. Instead, when you have more income, invest more. People who are financially secure have dedicated their time to spending less and investing more. This is why they are wealthy today.

Solution: Stop trying to get rich quick. Develop a long term outlook on investing, and stick with it. Start learning more about different types of stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, REITs, and IRAs. Set aside a small amount of money per month to invest. If wealth is what you aspire to have, operate as if you believe you are wealthy. Quit using the excuse, “I don’t have enough money to invest.” If you have money to eat out, shop, party, and go out on the weekend, you have money to invest. Start investing small, and do so every single month.

Shopping and eating out every day doesn’t matter. You Matter. The Most.






Nancy Johnson of Fresno, Calif. wrote, “Don’t ‘save’ experiences for retirement. Travel now, spend more time with friends, enjoy hobbies, read challenging books, go to concerts and plays, see great art, volunteer time, find enjoyable regular exercise, donate to causes that touch the heart and help the earth – whatever enriches your inner life. Savor as many of these experiences now, even on a limited budget. Accidents, unexpected illnesses, family obligations and other unanticipated crises may completely change what’s possible in retirement.”




Alan K. Homer of Mesa, Ariz., wrote, "To my younger self, I would give the mantra, ‘Save early, save often.’ The matching of the contributions from your employer and the compounding effect of time and average annual stock market returns will make retirement attainable and with a sustainable income. Good thing I listened. I can retire at 60 at my discretion. More likely I will still be working, but on my own terms.”




When I first started writing about achieving  financial independence early in 2009, I never thought the FIRE movement would reach such a huge level of interest a decade later. After all, only misfits decide to aggressively forgo material pleasures, save 50% or more of their incomes, and retire from well-paying jobs in their 30s and 40s.



Standard retirement advice is based on protecting people from any form of hardship or change, which is completely counterproductive. In the right quantity, these are the backbone of a good life and the fuel for personal growth. Without them, you will melt into a whining puddle in front of a television that endlessly blares Fox News.h


There’s a contingent of personal finance obsessives out there who’ve branded themselves as FI/RE, which is short for Financial Independence and Early Retirement. They’ve cut their day-to-day living expenses to the bone, while earning and investing aggressively, all with the intent of retiring well before the average retirement age (which is 62). For them, saving is more enjoyable and fulfilling than a big house, dinners out and lavish vacations. 

For me, financial independence means having enough that I’m comfortable walking away from a stable job if I so choose, that my children will live a comfortable life, and that my life (and theirs) won’t depend on some opaque company’s whims.

Financial independence doesn’t mean that everything will be easy and I’ll never have to worry about money again. But I want to be my own boss, and do things on my own terms. The only way I’m going to be able to do that, short of winning the lottery, is if I focus some energy on saving and investing my money smartly. It’s why I find things like attempting a financial detox and setting money goals valuable. To me, not working for someone else my entire life is the encouragement I need to forego some (but obviously not all) spending. Stunts alone won’t make me financially independent, but it’s all a learning process.



Getting A Graduate Degree Is Contrary To FIRE

If your goal is to retire early, then getting a graduate degree doesn’t make sense unless you can go part-time or get your graduate degree in your early 20s.

The goal of FIRE is to break free from the grind as young as comfortably possible. By spending 1 – 4 years in graduate school, you are sacrificing precious time and money in order to hopefully leverage your degree for as long as possible.



For Mark and Amanda Tew, taking a yearlong mini-retirement in Nicaragua with their four children just felt right.

Mark has always had a love for Latin America, and he previously told Business Insider he felt the whole premise of traditional retirement was faulty.

"Waiting until I'm 65 when I'm likely less able or healthy enough to do the things I've always wanted to do doesn't make a lot of sense to me," he said. "Since I'm not retiring early anytime soon, a mini-retirement seemed like a great way to spend quality time and have a great new experience as a family."




Make saving a priority. Even if you don’t contribute to your 401(k) now, experts say you should likely start — at least putting in up to what your employer matches. Open enrollment typically takes place in the fall, so call HR and get the details of your plan and when you can sign up if you haven’t already.

This may take a rethinking of how you think about retirement savings: Jennifer Beeston, the vice president of mortgage lending at Guaranteed Rate who maxes out her 401(k) each year, thinks of savings as a necessity, not a luxury. “My 401k deposits are non-negotiable to me. It’s like a mortgage or electricity. It is a need not a want,” she tells Moneyish. To help her focus on putting savings first, she tells herself that “retiring is inevitable, and I want to have quality of life when I retire.”


Saramaya Penacho, 30, a San Diego-based publicist, and her husband Zach, think of it similarly: “We look at our 401(k) and IRA contributions as a fixed expense. After the basic necessities (food, housing), we first contribute to the retirement accounts – before considering anything else,” Penacho tells Moneyish.

Choose older and modest. You don’t have to go without the things you want — but you can make better choices about them. Principal’s research shows that one of the top 3 sacrifices big-time savers make is to drive an older car, followed closely by living in a modest home. David Rae, who works as a financial planner at DRM Wealth Management, says that’s helped him save big: “I am driving a 2013 Lexus ES300 Hybrid. The car is paid off which allows me to put away about $600 more per month. I know plenty of people spending $1600 per month on their car payments, which I think is just crazy,” he explains.

This kind of thinking was widespread among other savers Moneyish talked to. Penacho says she and her husband prioritize saving for retirement over “new cars … or the latest iPhone.” And Rania Eldekki, who is the director of digital marketing at marketing agency Hudson and has been maxing out her 401(k) since last year, notes that “I drive an economical car, a Honda Civic” and “split rent with a roommate — and not on the fancy side of town.”

Slowly increase the amount you contribute. When you’re first starting out in your career, it can be hard to max your 401(k), and that’s OK: Ramassini says you can start slowly — try to at least contribute up to what your employer matches if you can — and amp up savings each year, even if it’s just by 1%. That’s the approach that Eldekki takes. For the past five years she’s upped her contributes by about 2.5% annually, until she hit the max last year. And she says she plans to continue to max it out: “I get less now with the goal of having more in the future,” she explains.

Don’t look at saving as a sacrifice, Rae says. Instead, it will be easier to save if you think of it in terms of what you gain by doing it, be that a cushy life at the beach upon retirement or the ability to switch to a beloved, but low-paying career. Indeed, two thirds of big-time savers say their motivation for saving is to think about having a good lifestyle in retirement, according to Principal’s research. “I love what I do and may work into my 70s, but I get a ton of joy knowing that I am on track to have financial freedom at around the age of 50. That means work is an option and I can spend tons more money on things I enjoy like travel or wine with friends,” Rae says.



Make increases automatic — and add any bonuses to the pot. “Set your contribution to automatically increase each year,” says Alexander S. Lowry, a professor of finance at Gordon University. That way, you’re automatically saving more every year, even if it’s just a modest 1% increase. “And if you receive a bonus you can contribute from that – since it’s a bonus you weren’t banking on it so you can afford to contribute from it,” he adds.




I'm 27 and I've saved $200,000 — here are the 7 best pieces of advice I can give you about money When I graduated college, I had $65 dollars to my name. I couldn't even afford my diploma. 10 years later, I have XXX. You'd think I was either stock picking genius or face-paced superstar. The truth is, I'm neither of those. My stock investments mostly underperformed compared to the benchmarks, and until very recently, my salary wasn't much more than the average income in my city.

In reality, I'm a normal guy with a decent job, who was lucky enough to stumble onto some money tips early in life. Here are my seven best:

2. Avoid consumer debt
Once you're out of school and on your way to making money, the next best step is to avoid the trap of consumer debt.

Put simply, it's nearly impossible to build wealth if you're leaking money every month through auto loans and credit card debt.

Benjamin Franklin, one of the country's first early retirees , famously said that a small leak will sink a great ship. And he's right; trying to build wealth while paying interest is like rowing against the current. With a leaky boat.

In order to avoid debt, I bought my $13,000 car without a loan, and although I use credit cards for the rewards points, I've never paid a cent of interest.

This keeps compound interest working for me, rather than forcing myself to swim against the current.

3. Embrace index funds
Like most beginning investors, when I started investing I imagined myself the next Warren Buffet. All my stock picks were sure home runs, I thought, and I'd be crushing the market in no time.

In reality, my not-so-hot stock choices lagged the indexes. By the end, my ambition mixed with greed cost me thousands of dollars.

This shouldn't have been a surprise. There's simply too much proof - individual stock pickers, traders, and actively managed mutual funds just can't compete with the efficiency of index funds.

Don't try to outsmart the market; you're fighting a losing battle. Instead, save yourself the time AND money by choosing a low-fee index fund.

Building wealth is simple. Not easy, but simple. We'd all like to make more money, but if your long term prize is financial independence, there aren't any shortcuts. There are only these four basic rules.

4. Decide if your spending is actually making you happy
Government surveys show that 52% of the average person's budget is spent on housing, cars, and materialistic purchases.

Does a house with all those extra bedrooms really make your life happier, or are you just creating more work for yourself?

When you part with your money, are you carefully calculating the potential benefits, or are you just following what your friends, society, and billions of dollars of advertising is telling you to do?

For me, I realized stainless steel appliances and granite countertops weren't impacting my life, so I chose a more mediocre apartment to save hundreds each month in rent. I also decided my morning commute would be pretty similar whether I was driving a $30,000 car or a $13,000 one, so I found a ride cheap enough to buy in cash.

Figure out how to reduce your no-fun spending to the bare bones, and saving becomes a breeze. The best part? If you decide something really will make you happy, you'll easily be able to afford the splurge.

5. Tax advantages are, you know… advantages. Use them!
Retirement accounts, like a 401(k) or IRA, grow tax free. In the case of a traditional retirement account, you only pay taxes on the back end. For a Roth account, you only pay taxes on the front end.

Compared this to a non-retirement account, where you have to pay taxes on the back end, front end, and even some of the middle… end. These tax advantages are huge!

Even a retirement account with slightly higher fees allows your money to grow faster , which means you can retire hundreds of thousands of dollars richer.

6. Avoid lifestyle inflation
As we move through life, it's easy to want to spend more and more money rewarding ourselves. Most people give into this temptation, start jealously eyeing the latest purchases of their friends, and begin inflating their lifestyles accordingly.

These over inflated lifestyles feed off each other, creating a vicious cycle of "keeping up with the Joneses." Like a giant bubble, the lifestyles grow so big there's eventually nowhere else to go. The Joneses are tapped out, and they're left no choice but to spend all their time and money protecting their over-inflated bubbles from anything that could cause a pop.

I say, screw the Joneses. Chances are, they're a financial mess and can't afford most of what they're buying anyway.

Instead, recognize that your life is already awesome, and hold steady. Your savings, and ultimately your lifestyle, will blow past the Joneses in no time.

7. Wealth is built through consistency, not home runs.
Shortly behind never getting started, one of the most common investing mistakes people make is investing too aggressively.

It's an understandable mistake to make. Our minds aren't really designed to intuitively grasp the incredible power of compound interest, and trying to envision years into the future quickly fogs into a hazy blur.

As a result, many beginning investors mistakenly think the only way to get rich is to take huge risks. They swing for the fences, then find themselves frustrated when their dangerous bets lose money.

As I look back on my path so far, I'm amazed by something simple. I haven't hit any jackpots. Hell, I haven't even come close. I didn't create a hugely profitable company, I didn't get rich quick on a 10-bagger stock, and I didn't strike gold on any highly leveraged real estate deals.

Instead, almost all my investments are pretty darn boring. I invested in low-fee index funds, took advantage of retirement accounts, and consistently saved a lot of money.

I wasn't swinging for the fences. I've just hit a lot of singles, over and over again.

We live in an incredible time of opportunity. The 401(k) account exists. Tax rates are low, at least historically. And the invention of the index fund means anyone with access to a phone or computer can outperform hot shot money managers, and pay only pennies to do so.

The singles are there for the taking. Keep shooting for singles, and before you know it, you'll realize you've hit a home run.










1. Spend Less
Let's start with the thing you have the most control over: your spending. Most people in America can spend less, although we often don't feel that way. Everyone I know who travels to a poor country comes back shocked at how well we live here. Most of us have no idea. Even if we feel like we don't have much, our life is luxury compared to billions of people around the world.

Much of our spending stems from social pressure, successful advertising, or simply from our perception that "we can afford it." Absent from that decision making process is the key question: how will this purchase make me wealthy twenty years from now?

If there's a common theme from the lives of people who succeeded financially, it's that they spent less than they earned. Are there things "on the margin" you might be able to do without in order to spend less than you make? Take a look at your spending and find out. Whether you're a big spender or completely broke, everyone needs a budget.

2. Earn More
Of course, there is an even more obvious way to build wealth, though it's significantly harder: earn more money. Everyone has opportunities before them to earn more, but they aren't always easy, and they aren't 100% in your control like your spending is.

3. Pay Off Debt
Debt is like a fire: you can do a lot with it, but it can kill you, too. All it takes is for the wind to change direction or one little thing to go wrong. Debt can be incredibly useful, but most people are unaware of its dangers, as the ten million people who lost their homes in the Great Recession can testify.

4. Invest
You either get money from what you do (job or business) or what you own. You'll never retire until you make that transition, because retirement requires making a living solely from what you own—that is, your retirement savings. Unless you were born rich, the only way to have enough to live on when you retire is to invest your money, and the earlier you start, the better.

You know you'll never get beyond the lowest person on the totem pole at work unless you apply yourself to getting better at your job, right? Investing is your "next job:" you have the option of sticking your head in the sand and pretending you can live without it, or you can realize your future depends on it and learn what you can to do well.



For years, I spent my days waking up early and rushing to wash, dress, and sit in traffic only to sit in a cube waiting to rush home. All that time, I was propped up by dreams of a freer life. It’s been two years since I quit my job. In some ways it’s the life I spent years dreaming of, and in some ways, it’s been very different.



growing movement thinks that the traditional retirement age of 65 is too old, and argues that with some smart planning and serious frugality, you should be able to retire earlier than that.

Way earlier.
The idea of this movement is to cut your expenses and maximize your savings to allow you to reach financial independence and a very early retirement. The movement calls itself FIRE—short for financial independence / retire early.

What is the FIRE movement?
The FIRE movement is made up of people around the country who think that you should be well before you hit your 60s, with some even advocating for retiring by 30. If you think that’s impossible, just look at one of the de facto leaders of FIRE, Mr. Money Moustache.

In real life, Mr. Money Moustache goes by the name Peter Adeney. Adeney and his wife strived to live an incredibly frugal lifestyle in their hometown of Longmont, Colorado. They saved about 50 percent of their income in low cost Vanguard funds, according to his website. Between the low cost of living, two rental properties, and Vanguard investments, he was able to retire at 30 years old!

Steps to extreme frugality
To make FIRE work, you need to combine both aggressive savings with extreme frugality. This is probably the most difficult part of FIRE for most people with a middle class income. If you have read about frugality before, you may have just been scratching the surface compared to how some people in the FIRE community choose to live.

Save 50 percent or more of your income
What do you do with all of this extra savings when you are no longer handing it over for regular purchases, shopping, and bills? Save it in a low-cost index fund. Many FIRE focused families and individuals put all of their money in Vanguard’s S&P 500 index fund; it charges just 0.04 percent in fees for the Admiral version, which is available for those with at least $10,000 to invest.

But that doesn’t mean you can’t learn something from the FIRE movement. If you can take small steps to cut expenses and grow savings, you might just find yourself on track for an early retirement, too—maybe not by 30, but certainly well before you turn 65.





1) You’ll need less than you think
My biggest surprise since retiring has been how much less I need to live a comfortable retirement life. Like any good retiree, we plan for multiple scenarios over an extended period of time before making a decision. I spoke with at least three dozen retirees about retirement spending and they all said they are spending much less than they anticipated. For myself, on average, I’m spending 30 percent less than projected.

It costs nothing to play tennis at a public park. There are plenty of cheaper food alternatives once you no longer have to work in an expensive downtown area. You can read all the latest magazines at your local library, surf the web, and enrich your mind with classic literature for free. Take one look online and you’ll find a plethora of free activities.




These days college gets a pretty bad rep. And I agree, the skyrocketing price of tuition is concerning. But I’m also with Warren Buffett on this one - the best investment you can ever make is in yourself.

Here’s the key. You need to view college for what is: a 4-year transaction to purchase a career. Especially when student loans are involved.These days college gets a pretty bad rep.

And just like you wouldn’t take out a mortgage before researching the value of a house, it’s equally important to consider the value of a degree.

Some degrees pay well, others... not so much. Research salary statistics , interview people in the field, and attend career fairs




 Compared to several years ago, when I had less money, I still have the same life.

I wake up, drink my freshly brewed coffee, read a good book, and then start working until about 3 or 4 in the afternoon. Then, I put on my shorts and t-shirt and start working out.

Sometimes I listen to music during my workouts, and sometimes I don’t. After working out, I have dinner with my family. We watch a TV show or movie after we eat. And then, I get back to working or reading.

You see, it doesn’t take much money to live a good life. Benjamin Graham, one of the most respected investors of all time, once told his apprentice:

“Money isn’t making that much difference in how you and I live. We’re both going down to the cafeteria for lunch and working every day and having a good time. So don’t worry about money, because it won’t make much difference in how you live.”


1. Live Lean
I keep my expenses as low as possible without sacrificing the quality of life. My apartment isn’t big, my mortgage is low and so are my energy and water costs. I drive a Fiat 500, and my car insurance is €26 a month. And I only fill it up with gas once a month because I live close to my office, friends, and family.

I stopped buying fashionable items like gadgets and clothes that are “in.” But I must say, I don’t save on my wellbeing. I buy books every month. I eat good food. And I go to a good gym. And I also built a small gym in my office.

You see, I don’t live like Mr. Money Moustache or minimalist folks, I have my own definition of living lean.

That is: Don’t spend your money on things that don’t give you lasting benefits.




DiValerio belongs to the FIRE movement, short for Financial Independence/Retire Early. It’s a term adopted by super savers who aim to quit the rat race decades before their peers, typically before they reach 40. 




While early retirement is not for everyone, I truly believe that becoming financially independent — that is having the financial means to stop working if you choose to — is an achievable and worthwhile goal for most Australians with a decent-paying job. More importantly, I feel that by working so much, I'm missing out on the rest of my life.






Picture yourself 30 years from now.

You could be done working, spending your days playing tennis, reading books, and enjoying time with your grandchildren.

Or you could still be working full time, exhausted at the end of the day, wishing you’d made different decisions when you were younger.

For the majority of Americans, the latter is more likely. That’s because 55% have less than $10,000 saved for retirement and 34% don’t have any retirement savings at all, according to a GOBankingRates survey.

If you don’t want to end up as part of that statistic, you have to start planning now.

How much money do I need to retire?






When did saving become the enemy? When the topic of saving money comes up, it usually has a negative connotation. It normally goes something like this: “I’d love to save, but I just can’t afford to.” Instead of something positive like, “I know how important it is to save for my future, so I’m willing to make some sacrifices.”

We’ve all had that negative voice inside of our head say, “Wow, they drive such an old beat-up car.” In reality though, what’s wrong with driving an old car? I would argue that living within your means is admirable. Most of us would agree that being financially independent is an incredibly powerful achievement and a dream for most Americans! One huge benefit of saving and living within your means is eventually being able to afford to retire! Yet most people don’t make the decision to invest in their future. According to financial services firm Edward Jones, only 37% of Americans save in an IRA. (What is an IRA?) Why aren't Americans saving? It's almost as if saving and living within your means is seen as a weakness or a negative thing. Let’s face it, saving money isn’t sexy. Going to the $35 exercise class, now that’s sexy. Buying the latest and greatest iPhone is sexy. But do these things actually make you happy? I’d venture to say that in the long-run they don’t. It’s no surprise that "40% of Americans can’t pay a $400 emergency expense. Which would you rather? Own a fancy car and appear as though you are rich just to fit in? Or save on that car and buy something more affordable so that you can add to your savings account and get closer to a comfortable retirement? I think the answer is clear. There is nothing glamorous about owning a fancy car if in reality you are broke and living paycheck to paycheck. While painfully obvious, it’s critical to understand that a small increase in your savings rate (e.g. from 3% to 6%) would allow you to save 2x as much money, while not meaningfully changing your standard of living.





When I was young, I never thought about enjoying my retirement. My life stretched before me and I thought I was eternal. I wanted to look good, buy things, feel rich. I worked hard but I lived beyond my means and got into credit card debt to the tune of £10,000. My family and I are having to make sacrifices now because of the way I behaved then. I only had three days off last year and Christmas Day was one of them. I haven’t seen my wife or my children for several months and I miss them.

I would do things differently if I had my time again. I would save my money right from the get-go instead of going on yachting holidays and buying a BMW 5-Series on credit. If I had invested the money I spent on the finance and insurance for that car, I reckon I would have more than £300,000 saved up by now. Instead, I have £9,000 of debt and have to spend £211 on loan repayments each month. One of the lessons I have learned is not to spend more than I’ve got. I just wish I had learned it when I was younger. I’ve been stupid in my life and not saved like I should have. I was always waiting for a big payday. I got a shock at 55 when I realised that, even though I had worked all my life, I had less than £4,000 saved up in pensions – I had no other savings.





4. A house can limit your freedom and flexibility
A house is a big responsibility that requires a lot of care and attention — especially if you want to maintain its value over time.

Of course, if your favorite thing to do is work on your house or in the yard, go for it! But for me and many others, the inherent obligation in owning and maintaining a home means less time and energy for travel, working on hobbies or passions, or pursuing important business goals.

I want to direct my money, time, and energy into what's most important to me in life. A house would eat away at all those things, and leave me with less power to choose how I spend them.



5. Renting means getting to live lighter
My wife and I don't have conversations about "Should we buy new countertops?" or "Let's get a new washer and dryer."

We don't have a big empty house we need to fill up; we rent an apartment that offers only the space we actually need. We're not necessarily minimalists, but we do seem to have far less material stuff than a lot of our home-owning friends. And there's less attachment to the physical space because we don't own it.

That doesn't mean we don't take care of it. We just don't get distracted by stuff that doesn't actually matter to us in the long run, like fancy home decor, upgrades, or renovations.







Here’s another line from The Millionaire Next Door to convince you: “Being frugal is the cornerstone of wealth-building.”

Visualizing the impact of your savings rate

How, exactly, does a higher savings rate translate to an earlier retirement?

Your savings rate is key not just because it means you’re saving a higher percentage of your income, but also because it reflects the amount of money you can live on. This is the more important takeaway about an individual’s savings rate. For instance, even though someone with take-home pay (gross income minus taxes) of $200,000 a year and a 50% savings rate is saving far more than someone with $60,000 of take-home pay and a 50% savings rate, both individuals will be ready to retire at the exact same time. This is because the $60,000 earner has structured their life to live on far less than the $200,000 earner.

In the following chart, the impact of the savings rate on how long it will take someone to become financially independent is clear. Assuming a 5% return on saved money after inflation, a 4% annual withdrawal rate after retirement, and a large enough portfolio for it to outlast withdrawals, here’s how a savings rate would affect working years until retirement:


Data for chart, rounded to the nearest year, is based on table in Mr. Money Mustache’s blog. Chart by author.
Your savings rate has an unmistakable influence on your ability to become financially independent. Even by simply upping your savings rate from 10% to 20%, you could shave off over 14 years from your retirement timetable. Not bad at all — and probably worth the effort.

Importantly, Mr. Money Mustache believes many earners can cut their expenses without reducing their happiness. Indeed, there are some activities that can both save money and make life more enjoyable, like riding a bike for short errands. And Adeney doesn’t even urge readers to live in a shack or a tiny home. Bigger savings are achievable “ten bucks at a time,” he says. Think: Use less electricity; eat out less during work hours; ditch cable TV; and have more discipline about random purchases like shoes, gadgets, or lawn care.

If you can internalize how integral your savings rate is to your ability to set money aside, invest it, and eventually become financially independent, this may be the catalyst you need to begin allocating capital with more discipline, ultimately helping you spend less and retire earlier. As Mr. Money Mustache says on his blog, “It’s just basic math....”

If the math favors higher savings rates this much, the well-intentioned advice to pay yourself first with a tenth of your income is arguably doing you a disservice. Do yourself a favor and look for ways to get your savings rate even higher. You’ll retire much earlier.




There’s zero reason to stop sharing, he says, if you’re physically and mentally able to give. “I am essentially against retirement as it is promoted in our culture. When you shut down your brain, when you cease exercising the intellectual muscle, you begin the process of death. Most of us will live well into our eighties. The idea that at the magical age of 65 you are supposed to shut down your brain is an insane waste of human capital. Most of us who are in the knowledge economy are at our peak of intellectual skills and value when we are condemned to retirement. One could argue that this is a form of age-based genocide.



	hile many people associate frugality with an austere lifestyle, the opposite couldn't be more true. Being frugal actually allows consumers to spend money on what they truly value while saving on the things they don't. "Frugality gives you freedom because you see how spending in some areas is keeping you from what you want in other areas," says John Schmoll, founder of FrugalRules.com. "Frugality isn't about deprivation. It's about being purposeful with your spending, and about finding balance and spending on what you value." Consumers who seek to be more frugal have to set their priorities and learn to live without certain things to be able to afford others.




3. The future is unknown

The average 65-year-old man today will live until 84.3, while the average 65-year-old woman will live until 86.6. But will you make it to your mid-80s or beyond? Maybe. The fact of the matter is that you just don’t know, and that’s reason enough to retire as soon as you’re able. Even if your health is great at present, it’s impossible to say when things might start to deteriorate. Heck, you could walk out the door tomorrow and get hit by a bus, and suddenly, there go your retirement plans.

Of course, this isn’t to say that you should be scared to leave the house, and looking both ways before venturing out into the road will reduce your risk of the aforementioned scenario. The point, however, is that none of us have a crystal ball to tell us how much time we have left on this planet, so if retirement is something you’ve been eager to experience for a long time, you might as well go for it.




What is Retirement?

Recently I did an interview and was asked, “How do you define retirement?”

My response was as follows:

I define it as the freedom to do what you want.

Back in the day retirement was generally defined as 1) you quit work and 2) you indulged in leisure activities like golf, bowling, traveling, and so forth until you eventually died.

Today I think “retirement” is getting rebranded, especially by those of us doing it earlier than the traditional age, to mean something else. Or perhaps I’m not “retired”, I’m just “financially independent.”

Whatever you call it, I don’t work for an employer and spend all my free time on what I want — some of those things being investing and running a couple websites and some of them being more leisurely like traveling, reading, and so forth.

The definition of retirement is changing, even for those retiring at a more traditional age. People are living longer. And they are remaining in better health longer. So while retirees at 65 used to sit back and take it easy, these days they are having hips replaced and running marathons.

Today’s early retirees are just an exaggeration of this trend. They have even more time, energy, fitness, and so on for activities. Some of their interests are recreational and some are work-related. The only difference now is that the work is something they choose to do versus something they have to do.





Kristy Shen was in her twenties working in information technology in Toronto when she knew something had to change. Her job was stressful and unfulfilling, and she was starting to have panic attacks. Then on what seemed like a typical work day her office mentor collapsed at his desk and was carted out on a stretcher. “I was like shit. This job is literally going to kill me.” 

It was around that time that she stumbled into the FIRE movement, a group of young people who hope to retire early and pursue their passions by stashing away huge amounts of money in their twenties, thirties and forties, then living off their savings and investments for the rest of their lives.

FIRE literally stands for “Financial Independence Retire Early.” While the idea of retiring early is nothing new, the formation of an online community to promote that goal and share strategies for achieving it began to take off around 2001 with the blog Early Retirement Extreme. Today it has become wildly popular: a Reddit discussion board dedicated to early retirement has more than 380,000 subscribers, and one well-known evangelist of the movement, Mr. Money Mustache, gets millions of visitors to his blog each month.





How to pull off an early exit from the daily grind
Early retirees follow three basic steps to achieve their goal: Cut back on their spending so they can invest at least half of their annual income, invest in low-fee retirement accounts that generated steady returns, and build massive nest eggs before quitting their jobs.

For Kristy Shen living modestly wasn’t much of an adjustment. “Having grown up poor in China, cooking instead of eating out, taking public transportation and living in an older townhouse instead of a fancy downtown condo was no big deal.” She and her husband saved more than $1500 a month by staying in their slightly run down rental which cost around $900 a month versus the $2500 or more for nicer digs.

Resisting “lifestyle creep”, the practice of spending more after getting a raise is key as well. “When we got pay increases or bonuses, we just put the money straight into our investments,” Steve Adcock said.


FIRE may not be for everybody, but its tenets of setting financial goals, budgeting, and saving can help anyone looking to up their financial game. Establishing your financial priorities, whether they are saving for a house, paying off student loans, or early retirement is important, as is creating and living by a budget.

Whether you dream of quitting your job to travel the world in your 30s or retiring to Florida in your 60’s, having a financial plan is always a smart move.


Adcock, now 36, is the first to tell you that saving money doesn't get you rich — and it isn't "the magic sauce to early retirement" — but it still helps. He and Courtney set aside up to 70 percent of their combined income, which ranged from $200,000 to $230,000 a year.

If you want to bank half your income or more, start the way the Adcocks did: Track your spending.

"We know exactly what we bring in and exactly what we spend — and on what," writes Adcock, who wasn't always thrifty and only saved "the bare minimum" in his 20s. "Knowing where our money goes is critical to maximizing our savings and pinpointing where we could probably cut back."

They prefer using an Excel spreadsheet, but sites like Personal Capital, Mint and You Need a Budget will keep track of your purchases for you. "You have to know what you are spending before you can plan your retirement budget," says Justin. Plus, "knowing how you spend lets you determine whether you get value for your dollars, and where you might be able to focus efforts to reduce expenses further." If you need extra motivation, think about how many hours of your life it took to save up the money you're about to spend to make a purchase. Ask yourself "if another year of working for a living is worth that shiny new thing," says Adcock.






financial moves you'll regret:

- failing to invest when you're young
- buying a house you can't afford
- racking up credit card debt
- choosing a college based on price

"It has never made sense to me to work your whole life and save all of the fun and enjoyment for the end, when you might not have the health or energy to do the things you want," he told Business Insider. "Not to be morbid, but we're not even guaranteed a long life so we need to enjoy today and not postpone truly living."




Eventually he found a well-paying job working in cyber-security, took out a mortgage and bought a condo, and financed a BMW.

But then he started to wonder: is this all there is?

"I finally said, 'I can't do this for 40 years,'" recalls Reining.

In his late 20s, Reining started searching for alternatives. He read the book, "Your Money or Your Life," by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin. "It helped me realize there's a way to arrange your life so you don't have to sit in this cubicle for 40 years and the idea of becoming financially independent became real."




Take the popularized “4% rule” as an example. It’s a rule of thumb that says you can withdraw 4% of your portfolio value each year in retirement without incurring a substantial risk of running out of money. Using this rule, for every $100,000 you have, you’d withdraw $4,000 a year. This rule is based on solid academic research. That’s great. We all like historical research, particularly when it comes to serious topics like making sure you don’t outlive your savings. But the research used a “set it and forget it” approach — it did not account for the ability to adjust behavior along the way. In other words, basing your retirement withdrawals on such a rule is like planning your finances based on your situation at age 25, and then never again adjusting the plan.






Most people "romanticize" this idea of becoming rich and spending their days lazing around because they hate their nine-to-five jobs, says the millionaire. "They're so exhausted...and they're so in the rat race that they have no time to even decompress."

Kim likens the current corporate work-style to that of a robot: Employees wake up early, trudge to the office, perform an unfulfilling job, go home and start the process again. Yet most can't quit their jobs to pursue their true passion, he says, because they're bogged down with student debt, high mortgages and car payments.

Acquiring vast amounts of wealth is seen as the ultimate prize for many. But that's not the case for self-made millionaire Timothy Kim. In fact, Kim says he lacked a sense of purpose once he achieved his financial goal, which then led to boredom.

Kim, 31, immigrated to the U.S. during his late teens with just $500 in his pocket, he says. Last year, he became a millionaire after making successful investments in the stock market starting at age 19. Kim now runs a personal finance blog called TubofCash.com where he hosts cash giveaways and was featured by Business Insider in November.

"People tend to think that they want this kind of lifestyle where they're on vacation for the rest of their life and I actually disagree," he tells CNBC Make It. "I'm in this situation and I'm getting bored."

"They're basically drowning from unhappiness due to a lack of autonomy," explains Kim, which makes them fantasize becoming rich and retiring.

"Most people want to add value to society."
-Timothy Kim, self-made millionaire
However, those who prioritize accumulating wealth are left thinking "now what?" once they hit their goal, says the millionaire. "If someone gives you $100 million and you don't have to work anymore, you're going to quickly find out that life feels a little meaningless and you have this hole."

Kim notes that this is simply human nature. "Most people want to add value to society," he says. "They want to feel productive. They want to use their brain."

Though it may sound relaxing, Kim doesn't believe that people truly want to sit on a couch watching Netflix for 15 hours a day for the next 60 years or sipping martinis on the beach all day long.

"[People] think that they want that because they have so little downtime," he says. "But it gets boring super quick."

Additionally, more money does not result in higher levels of happiness or a stress-free life. A recent study of 4,000 millionaires from Harvard Business School found that only millionaires earning between $8 million to $10 million, experience higher levels of happiness than millionaires with lower levels of wealth. Even then, reports the study, a larger fortune is only associated with "modestly greater well-being."

Another study, by career platform LinkedIn, found that people who report making a higher income tend to face higher levels of stress at work and don't necessarily experience higher job satisfaction.



I built my net worth to over $500,000 in 4 years — here are the 10 best pieces of advice I can give you about money

By age 27, I had built a net worth of $500,000 in four years, which is about 65% real estate, 30% stocks, and 5% cash. From my experience, I've developed a simple three-step formula for building wealth that anyone can follow:

Spend less than you make
Save and invest the difference
Repeat
I'm now 28 and will be financially independent when I'm 30. To me, financial independence means unlimited flexibility. Achieving financial independence removes money from decision making and allows us to do what matters. I'll have the luxury to keep working but the flexibility to travel full-time without a job.



1. Make a budget and track your spending

Tracking your spending and creating a budget is a must. Most people don't know where their money goes. It's difficult to spend less than you make if you don't know how much you are spending or what you spend on.

A free tracking tool like Personal Capital is a great way to track your spending and build your wealth.

2. Pay yourself first

The average American saves only 5.7% of their income. Most people pay all their bills then spend the remainder. If there is anything "leftover" it is typically saved.

Paying yourself first is a great way to build wealth. What does it mean to pay yourself first?

Automate a portion of your paycheck to go towards savings and investing. Then, focus on paying your essential bills like rent and groceries. Enjoy spending some of the remaining money on whatever makes you happy. This guarantees you will save money and create wealth.

3. Avoid credit card debt
3. Avoid credit card debt

Albert Einstein famously said, "Compound interest is the Eighth Wonder of the World. He who understands it, earns it. He who doesn't, pays it."

Compound interest works either for you or against you. It works for you when you invest — your money will grow exponentially. Likewise, when you have credit card debt, your debt compounds and grows exponentially.

Credit card debt destroys wealth. The credit card companies usually charge high interest rates. The average interest rate is around 16%, but some cards charge over 25%.

Historically, the stock market averages about 10% return annually.

Since credit card debt compounds faster (at a higher rate) than traditional investments, your debt will grow more quickly than your savings and investments. Avoid credit card debt. It's OK to use credit cards, but only if you pay the balance off every month.



4. Build an emergency fund

Prepare for the unexpected. You should aim to set aside three to six months of living expenses in an emergency fund. Having cash on hand will help you through the tough times and avoid credit card debt.

An emergency fund will cushion you if you lose your job, have a medical bill or need to fix your car. Life happens — you should prepare for the worst and hope for the best.




5. Live like a college student for as long as possible (avoid lifestyle inflation)

The best advice I ever received was to live like a college student for as long as possible. I am not talking about hosting keg parties on Tuesday nights or pulling a Van Wilder. Some habits should fade over time.

Most people lived on a "'spaghetti" budget and were broke in college. There is no reason to develop a "caviar lifestyle" now that you have a job. Keep your spending in check and treat yourself occasionally. Most people tend to spend more money as their income goes up. This is often called lifestyle inflation and will keep you in the poorhouse.It's no secret that Americans on a whole are mostly unprepared for retirement -- but sadly, that includes those who are pretty close to reaching that stage.

Let's be clear: Without independent savings, there's a good chance you'll struggle financially as a senior. That's because the income you receive from Social Security won't be enough to cover your bills. In fact, it won't even come close. In a good-case scenario, it might pay for about half of your expenses, leaving you on the hook for the rest. And that's where your savings come in.


9. Invest early and often

The best time to start investing was 20 years ago. The second best time is today. The earlier you start investing the better. When you invest, your money is working for you. The longer you have your money working for you the more your money will grow (compound interest).

Investing shouldn't be complicated. Buying a low cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500 is a great way to start investing. I do this weekly. Index funds offer a simple way to invest and provide diversification.



10. Earn more

Saving and budgeting is great but will only take you so far. Earning more money will allow you to build wealth faster.

Great news — it's never been easier in history to make money thanks to the gig/share economy.

Side hustles such as dog walking, tutoring, or driving for ride shares are a great way to earn extra income. Part-time jobs are another great option.

If side hustling is not your style, you can focus on improving your skill set or asking for a raise. Consider earning a certification or additional degree; check to see if your employer offers continued education benefits. Job hopping is another great way to boost your earnings.

6. Keep your housing expenses in check

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about one-third of the average American's budget goes towards housing. Shelter typically is the largest expense in any budget. Minimizing your housing bill will increase your ability to save. I eliminated my housing expenses and get paid to live because of house hacking.

Don't buy or rent more house than you need.



house broke - people who buy nice houses because they believe that's what's expected of them or their friends and neighbors have it . .but truthfully, no one cares .. have no money, bc all their money goes to towards their mortgage

keeping up with the jones - i need to buy that 


Want something more specific?

Then check out this chart from personal finance blogger Zach of Four Pillar Freedom.

According to Zach, if you have zero savings and earn a seven percent rate of return and put away $333 per month at age 20 you could retire as a millionaire by 65. If you put away $24,000 annually at 30 then you can reach that milestone by age 50.

Here�s the most interesting observations from Zach:

If you save $10,000 annually you can become a millionaire in 30 years, no matter your age.
If you save $20,000 annually you can become a millionaire in 22 years, no matter you age.
If you save $40,000 annually you can become a millionaire in 15 years, no matter you age.
Anyone can become a millionaire by 65 if they save $4,000 a month if they start when they�re 20.


First, let�s consider the assumption underlying the ad: Being a homeowner is desirable and being a renter is undesirable. Many people who see the ad won�t question that assumption, as it�s so woven into the way Americans think and talk about homeownership. It comes partly from a fuzzy idea of the American Dream: house, picket fence, kids in the yard, etc. So many of us have accepted this that we rarely question the financial benefits of owning a home.

Turns out, they aren�t really there.

For one thing, houses depreciate over time. Anyone who�s sold a house understands that to attract buyers, you have to relentlessly update: roof, kitchen, carpet, paint. While you may ultimately sell for more than you bought, it�s usually because you poured so much money into maintenance � and, of course, because of inflation. While it�s possible for certain neighborhoods to evolve (OK, gentrify) and for certain homeowners to see property values soar, it's understood that in most cases, home prices reflect what people in an area are willing to pay. There�s no easy way to beat the system. Even Robert Shiller, Nobel Prize winner in Economics and co-founder of the Case-Shiller Index, which tracks property values, has said that, in most cases, buying a home is not a great investment. Unlike the NAR, Shiller�s argument relies on economic realities (rather than emotional ploys). When you consider economic factors like the opportunity cost of a down payment, real estate taxes, maintenance, title and closing costs, selling fees and more, it becomes clear that homeownership is less of a �sure thing� than real estate agents like to suggest. Renters, of course, don�t have to worry about any of these � maintenance costs are built into rent. Renters can put down payment dollars into investments with greater liquidity and greater returns (housing offers about zero appreciation each year; stocks offer 9.8% dividends). Some even argue that homeownership cannot be considered an �investment� at all. Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad, points out that investments put money in your pocket, while a mortgage does just the opposite.Even disregarding the financial reasons it doesn�t make sense to own a home for most people, consider the lifestyle reasons: Today�s young adults are less likely to have children than previous generations, meaning they�re less likely to need the space a house provides. They�re also more likely to have educational debt, which makes taking on mortgage-related debt unattractive (or infeasible). Finally, they�re not tied to location: 84% are willing to relocate for a job and 82% believe they�ll need to relocate to advance professionally.






When you think of retirement, you most likely believe that means working until you�re in 60�s, but here�s the thing: retirement is a financial number, not a specific age. This means that if you follow the following savings plan, you�ll be able to retire in fifteen years or less, regardless of your current age.





#3. Reduce cost of living no matter how much you earn. Although I spent money on luxury items (which I eventually came to regret), my total living expenses are 80% less than anyone I know. Instead of living in Manhattan, I chose to continue living with roommates in a modest neighborhood in Brooklyn. Instead of leasing a new BMW or Maserati, both of which I could easily afford, I continued to use my trusty old Prius.

Instead of eating at the finest restaurants, drinking (Manhattan charges $15 per cocktail including tip), going out to bars, buying table service at clubs, vacationing in 5-star resorts, I continued to view financial independence as my #1 priority. That means, I shop clearance, I go on cost-efficient vacations, and I eat $5-10 dollar meals.

#4. Invest 95% of your income. If you want to retire young, you need your money to work for you as much as possible.



Think of your retirement savings as three buckets. The first bucket should hold enough cash and short-term investments to cover your living expenses for a year or two, when combined with your Social Security benefits, pension and other income. The second bucket, mentally earmarked for the middle years of retirement, holds bonds; the third bucket, with stocks, covers the last years.

If you�re within a few years of retirement or already retired, start filling up that spending bucket now, by selling a portion of your biggest-winning stocks and putting the proceeds in cash investments, like a money-market fund and a short-term bond fund. Once you stop working, you�ll pull money for living expenses from this part of your portfolio and replenish, as needed, from the other two buckets.

There�s a psychological benefit to this strategy too: Knowing that near-term expenses are covered, says Benz, �helps keep people in their seats at market inflection points.�

Alternatively, says Wade Pfau, professor of retirement income at the American College and author of the new book, �How Much Can I Spend In Retirement?� once you retire, you could use some of your savings to buy an immediate annuity from an insurance or investment company. This financial product provides a guaranteed monthly income for life. (You can see how much money you�d receive monthly based on your age, gender and the amount you�re investing here.)

The downside of an immediate annuity: You typically give up access to your money in exchange for the lifetime income guarantee. And if you die soon after buying it, you will have shelled out a relatively large amount for a small number of payments. (You can buy an immediate annuity to be left to your heirs, but it will pay less income.)

The upside: Studies from Towers Watson and others show that retirees who annuitize tend to be happier and feel they have a higher standard of living than those who rely on savings alone.



Sometimes, it's easy to overlook all of the tiny little "leaks" in your budget. People often don't realize how much they're spending.

It's easy to think that you're not buying anything lavish. You're not dining at the Ritz. You're not flying to Paris. You don't drive a Mercedes-Benz. Where on earth is all of your money going?



The "Problem" With Discretionary Spending
None of these discretionary purchases are "wrong" or "right." They're simply choices. If you want to spend money on these items, you need to cut other expenses out of your budget.

The core of budgeting is prioritizing: Cut the expenses that are less important to you, so that you can leave room in the budget for the spending that really matters.




4) Envision your 60 year old self working the cash register at McDonald�s. One of my biggest motivators for saving and paying down debt was seeing senior citizens working minimum wage jobs. While I admired them dearly for continuing to work, they also scared me straight into saving more because I didn�t want to be them one day. Instead, I wanted to be relaxing on a beach with a Mai Tai in one hand watching the sunset with my lovely wife. The more we can envision ourselves in poverty, the more incentivized we can be to max out our 401k.

5) Do it for your family. If you�re not willing to get in shape, save aggressively, and invest wisely for yourself, then at least do so for your family. There�s not a day that goes by where I don�t think about ways in which to give my son and my wife a better life. When you know you�ll likely die before your spouse and child, you�ll start focusing on your finances much more seriously.



e focus on the top 80% of happiness and spend our money there. If you love cars and cars bring you so much joy, spend money on cars. If you love skiing, spend your money on skiing. If you love board games, buy that $60 game you�ve always wanted to play. Spend your money here and don�t regret it. If budgets are tighter make sure you allocate adequate funds for these expenses. You know they bring you the most happiness in life so just enjoy them. We spend all of our time thinking about the happiness of our future self, but I bet that when we finally become that future self we�ll look back and wish we had done more for our current self.

That being said, this section is about minimizing expenses so how do we do that? We cut the rest, or at least most of it. If cars don�t mean a lot to you, don�t dump a ton of money on cars. If you don�t care about scuba diving don�t buy the gear. Even if you want to scuba once or go on a trip just rent and be good with that. Pass on buying that nice watch, drop the daily coffee, don�t buy that brand new guitar. Whatever it is that you don�t have listed in those top points try to eliminate as much of your spending on them as possible.

I have so many friends that can�t understand where their budget is going and then when I look at their monthly expenses I see things like: netflix, cable tv, hulu, amazon prime, barkbox, house accessories, new clothes, eating out, daily Starbucks, etc. They indulge themselves in anything that could possibly bring a tiny bit more happiness instead of focusing on the main things. A good friend of mine bought 3 guitars over the course of last year. I�ve never heard him play guitar in my life. I�m sure we can all look around our apt/house and find many purchases that we haven�t touched or have only used a couple of times, and I bet you a majority of them fall into those lower happiness categories. They sound fun in the moment but we only have so much time in our day and we generally want to fill it with the things that makes us happiest so we continually default to our top choices and these extras never reach the table to justify the spending.



Education Will Improve Financial Health

You don�t have to be rich to get a great education because access to information is now free. I wish I was reading personal finance sites back in 2007. If I did, I wouldn�t have over-leveraged myself into a vacation property that ended up losing half its value a couple years later. I wish I read even more about entrepreneurship. If I did, I would have started this site years earlier and left the salt mines of Corporate America sooner.

Soak up as much information as you can and share your favorite articles with as many people as possible. Personal finance sites aren�t going to eradicate poverty. But imagine if every single person in the country read a personal finance article at least once a week. I�m absolutely positive we�ll see a tremendous improvement in our finances over the next generation. Once you have your finances sorted out, you can focus your attention on more important things such as family, health, and happiness. And when your finances are really good, you can even spend your time and money helping other people!



Investing is one of the main ways to make sure your children don�t end up further and further behind. If you don�t invest, your sons or daughters will have a much harder chance of getting into a prestigious university or getting a sweet job because the spots will all be taken by kids of wealthy parents who buy their children�s way into everything. When there are 10 applicants for one spot that all look alike, the tie-breaker often comes down to money or connections.

Not only am I investing the majority of my income every month so that my son can have more options by 2035, I�m also working hard at building contingency plans, just in case he doesn�t do well in school, is discriminated against based on his race, gets into an accident, and I can�t compete in terms of donations and connections.


Anyways, if you reverse the math on all this you can simply multiply your yearly spending by 25 to find your �number�.

You should do this right now.

Because when you multiply your spending by 25 you start seeing that becoming financially independent isn�t about how much money you have, it�s about how much you spend, because how much you spend determines how much you need.

Here, let me show you:

Spend $20,000 you need $500,000
Spend $40,000 you need $1 million
Spend $80,000 you need $2 million
Spend $120,000 you need $3 million
Spend $160,000 you need $4 million
When you hear people say that $1 million or $2 million isn�t enough they�re not wrong, but what they�re saying is they have an expensive lifestyle.

And having an expensive lifestyle is fine, but years ago I realized that my number would be lower if I spent less, and if I spent less I�d have more to save, and if I had more to save then I�d get to my number faster.

That�s how you become financially independent � it�s all about the relationship between your numbers.






What's the point of FIRE is you spent 20 years going through hell so you can RE and die in 10 years? Sometimes it makes sense not to take the high stress job that pays tons of money simply because it will get you to FIRE sooner. Maybe take a slower path to FIRE and enjoy your life while you're getting to FIRE.

Personally, I've never really understood what motivates some people on the FIRE path. They talk about getting there asap and they speak as if every day working is another foot in the grave.

I love my work. I don't want to be doing it until I'm 80 but I can't imagine doing nothing either.

My goal with FIRE is to have more control over how I choose to spend my time, not to never work again. Yes, I want to option to never work again but that doesn't mean that i don't want to work if I feel I'm getting something more than money out of it.






Invest in your retirement first, then set your spending based on what you have left.

You also don�t have to choose between saving for retirement and paying off debt like a mortgage or student loan.

Do both.

Always make your required monthly debt payment, and contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to receive an employer match.

Apply any remaining funds to whichever is higher � your interest rate (pay down debt) or expected investment return (fund retirement).




Housing, transportation, food



If you ask the average millennial a basic question about their finances, they’ll go blank. With millennials now at the age of financial independence, this is a big problem. The average 18-24 year old has less than $1,000 in their savings account, and over $30,000 in student loans.

It’s no wonder that so many millennials experience anxiety about their finances, more so than baby boomers did at the same age. They’re more cautious about spending, and less able to make their dreams like owning a home and saving for retirement a reality. 3. You’re Not Tracking Your Spending. Do you ever feel like money seems to drain out of your bank account? Chances are you aren’t tracking your spending. 38% of Americans don’t track their spending, and more than half of Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck.

When you track your spending, you can bring awareness to nasty habits that are draining your money, and replace them with wiser spending decisions. “Track your expenses,” Thakkar says. “It’s ok if you spend your money. I’m a firm believer about having fun. But we don’t have to be stupid about it. Think about it, if you want to go to Coachella next year, why not invest that money and have that money pay for your Coachella ticket?” 4. You’re Not Setting Goals. It helps to have concrete financial goals—in fact, writing them down can make you 42% more likely to achieve them. Rather than the abstract, “I’d like to have more money in my account,” define a concrete goal that you can work towards and measure your progress against. “Grab a pen and paper and set goals,” says Thakkar. “Goals like, ‘I want to have 50k in my savings account, or ‘I want to have 25k in the stock market by next year’ are great places to start. Start putting money aside, put fifty or one hundred dollars aside each month and let it grow. Have 6 month, 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year goals. Make financial goals and start saving towards them.”






The millionaire next door

Takeaway #1 –  The Lessons and Advice from This Book Will Resonate Forever –  I wish I could quote them all, but here are the lessons that I will never forget and will always be on my mind as I strive to become a millionaire next door.

Income Does Note Equate to Wealth
Live Frugally, Play Great Defense with Your Money
Avoid Lifestyle Creep, Live Below Your Means
“Financial Independence Is More Important Than Displaying High Social Status”
Teaching Children to be Economically Self-Sufficient (See “Take #5”)





“The worst part about living paycheck to paycheck is that at the end of your working life, you literally have nothing to show for all of your hard work, except a small amount of equity in your home and your Social Security benefits. As a result, most people are forced to sell their home and survive on Social Security benefits when they can no longer work.”

I asked Bill why that was so, and he said people have a tendency to spend exactly what they make. They increase their standard of living as their income goes up. They buy bigger homes with bigger mortgages, bigger utility bills, higher maintenance costs, and higher real estate taxes. They buy more expensive cars. They go on more expensive vacations. They go out to restaurants more. They buy new furniture even though the old furniture looked just fine. It's called "lifestyle creep."

“So, what’s the solution? What’s the secret to being financially free when you stop working?” I asked. These were Bill’s exact words:

“Same house, same spouse, same car.”






In our journey to retire early and spend the rest of our lives pursuing our dreams or living life ON OUR TERMS, we look to scrape together every dollar.  Why?  Every dollar, every hustle, puts us one step closer to the end of the journey.


sting."

There are two types of over-spending that can ruin your finances:

• Over-spending on the little things – the small amounts that seep out of your pockets here and there and eventually become large.

• Over-spending on the big things – homes, cars, boats, cottages, and so on.

The top complaint I hear from people who don’t have balanced budgets is, “I don’t make enough money.”

I’m telling you that in the vast majority of cases (probably 95% or more), it’s not the amount these people make – but the amount that they spend that’s the problem. (In some cases it’s true that people simply don’t make enough money to save, invest, etc. As such, they need to concentrate on increasing their income as much as they need to control over-spending.)


"We're at a point now where the expectations of younger people are very, very high," Gruner said. "They want to eat out every day, they want to travel to Europe every year. The people that own homes today worked very, very hard for it, saved every dollar, did everything they could to get up the property investment ladder."

28m single, 200k NW in a relatively Low COL city. I earn 90k and save about 25-30k a year. I live on about that same amount 25-30k, but could pretty easily live on 20k if I wanted.
Honestly it feels great. I know that I can leave my job and be okay. I know that when I decide to buy a house I'll have a bunch of options, for 3.5% down to 20% down almost anywhere in my city I'd like. I like my job and I can definitely see myself doing it well into my 50s or 60s, but I think that having 6-10 years expenses saved up allows me to take risks in my career. It also allows me to cap my hours at 40-45 hours a week and focus on my many hobbies after work, knowing that I will be fine financially.
I desire FI so I can make career/work decisions independently of money, like someone else on this thread says, 200k is enough to really realize how freeing true financial independence is.



As others said, you can (almost) ALWAYS work longer to increase your retirement income.

Time, however, is the most valuable thing we have. We have a finite amount of it, and you can't really get any more.

Once you are in a position to retire, the question then becomes: do you have enough money now to make quality use of the rest of your time.

If the answer is yes, then of course you can still work longer.
You'll have more money, but less time. Is it worth it? If not, then it's probably time to retire.



When you’re in your 20s, who cares about living in a nice place? I was making over $100,000 and living in a living room with no doors! My guests didn’t mind. If you’re chilling at home, you’re not at work, which is exactly where you should be most of the time. If you’re bullish about your career, only then should you consider buying a property and spending ~30% of your gross income on housing.

Aggressively saving money on housing for 10 years will pay off. Keeping your housing expense to <10% means you can easily save and invest 50%+ of your income each month. Eventually, you may want to live in a nicer place if you find a partner or start a family. But from ages 20 – 34, living like a pauper is great for financial independence seekers!



I'm in my 40's. I've worked 20+ years in tech field. I've worked remotely from home for most of that time. I make about $170k per year, but I'm just tired of working. In fact I recently turned down a job offer making $200k to work from home. I read MMM blog every day to remind myself of my goal, and every day it gets more tempting.
I think I've come to the natural end of my interest and enthusiasm of working in my field. I've saved a ton of money, so I should be able to FIRE. But to walk away from an easy job making so much money seems wrong, and to boot it is an easy work from home job.
I know I'm burned out, and need some time off, like maybe a year or so. I just can't pull the trigger to quit, not just yet. Not sure what to do... I feel a little bit stuck.------------ At the end of the day, we've all stood at the edge of this same cliff. But, who had the balls to jump and hope they learned to fly? You need to be comfortable being uncomfortable, and that's hard to do when you've become accustomed to such a routine. Challenge yourself to get out of your comfort zone. Travel to remote countries. Stay in hostels. Talk to strangers. Get their views on life -- you'll meet some pretty interesting people that'll make you question what the hell you're doing with your life (and they likely make 90% less income).  -------- I'm in the tech field, work remotely, and am bored with my job. A couple years ago I went through some severe burnout and thought a more interesting job would be the solution. I got an offer from a company I'd been thinking about working at for a while but ended up turning it down though the salary was comparable.
Why? The other job would have absolutely been a wonderful intellectual challenge with an awesome team but I would have been devoting all my mental cycles to it. An easy, remote job especially when you're already FI leaves you so much more time and energy to devote to your real life: family, friends, hobbies.
I work to live now and could not be happier. But it took actually choosing to stay and knowing it was a CHOICE to get over the burnout and shift my perspective. --- Be careful. I am in the same boat but not as lucrative. I realize that if I quit, I'll lose about 25%-30% pay in the next job. That's just the nature of IT today so I stick it out. Also, we are within 5-6 years of landing the retirement plane so I see a light at the end.




What saving for FI has taught me is that I'm happier now spending less than I was before blowing money on material things that didn't add value to my life. I saved 70% of my income last year and there wasn't really anything I felt I was depriving myself of. If you told me tomorrow I'd have to work until I was 65 I doubt it would have any affect on my savings rate. My savings rate has become a side effect of living a simpler life that has made me happier. I'd likely donate most of that savings every year to charity if it was no longer being earmarked for FI.


15. If I was in my 20s and early 30s, using a roboadvisor to invest 20%+ of my after tax, after 401k maximum contribution is exactly what I would be doing. I wasted too much time trying to pick individual positions that either didnÕt make money, distracted me from my job, and/or gave me a lot of stress when I was younger.

Building wealth is all about having a regular contribution system over a long period of time. Allocate no more than 10% of your investable assets to trying to pick individual stocks if you must. The biggest problem retail investors have is not knowing how to manage risk.




The first idea – simple but easy to overlook – is that building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings rate. Fortunes can be blown as fast as they’re earned – and often are – while others with modest incomes can build up a fortune over time. Wealth is just the accumulated leftovers after you spend what you take in. And since you can build wealth without a high income but have no chance without a high savings rate, it’s clear which one matters more.

More important, the value of wealth is relative to what you need. A high savings rate means having lower expenses than you otherwise could, and having lower expenses means your savings goes farther than it would if you spent more. Since people require vastly different amounts of spending to get by each month, $1 of savings to one person is worth something totally different to another.

Past a certain level of income, what you need is just what sits below your ego. Everyone needs the basics, and once the basics are covered there’s another level of comfortable basics, and past that there’s basics that are both comfortable, entertaining, and enlightening. But spending past a pretty low level of materialism is mostly a reflection of ego approaching income, a way to spend money to show people that you have (or had) money. Think of it this way, and one of the most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income, but your humility.

But the best reason to save is to gain control over your time. Everyone knows the tangible stuff money buys. The intangible stuff is harder to wrap your head around, but can be far more valuable and able to increase your happiness. Savings gives you options and flexibility, the ability to wait and the opportunity to pounce. It gives you time to think. Every bit of savings is like taking a point in the future that would have been owned by someone else and giving it back to yourself.


This reinforces the importance of letting go of our traditional notions of what retirement is or should be. Many people spend their best years slaving away at a job to achieve a secure traditional retirement that never comes. Others are successful financially, only to discover the retirement they have been waiting for is not what they had been expecting.

I originally read FIRE blogs and felt that to find happiness I needed to be ultra-frugal to retire as quickly as possible. In the process I made myself very unhappy and created unnecessary stress in my life by trying to live up to someone else�s standards.

My wife and I ultimately realized that we needed to develop a retirement plan that reflected our needs and wants. This included building an ample security cushion and enabling a life of abundance consistent with our values, allowing access to the activities we love and the people that we want to spend time with. For example, we are avid skiers and we love to travel. Cutting these items from our budget was a non-starter.



Livingston landed a lucrative job straight out of college, earning $100,000 a year. However, she was determined to achieve her goal of financial independence and chose to live frugally, squirreling away 70% of her take-home pay into savings. Even as her income rose year after year, she refused to succumb to lifestyle inflation, choosing instead to put even more money toward her retirement goals.



Personally, I’m not exactly frugal—I just prefer to live like a grad student because it keeps life simple. Right now, my husband and I live on about 35% of what we make, net. We earn more than we used to, but we’ve been able to avoid lifestyle creep because our tastes haven’t shifted much and certainly haven’t improved much. (We splurge on food and travel. But we still drink $6 wine, buy used books, and get t-shirts from Uniqlo, none of which I regard as any kind of sacrifice.) In business, you’d call this operating leverage. Market willing, we should be able to retire in five years, when we’re 39 years old. Then we’ll start a company that “does whatever we want it to do.”

So how much money are we talking? To size your nest egg, you calculate your yearly living expenses and multiply them by 25. Then you invest and use the magic of compound interest to help you reach that goal. (Adeney suggests index funds—simple, low-fee investment vehicles that typically track the returns of the stock market.)

Once you’ve hit your number, you withdraw funds at a rate of 4% a year, known as the Safe Withdrawal Rate. A $1 million nest egg, for example, would yield $40,000 each year. A $2 million nest egg would yield $80,000. Simulations of model portfolios suggest this rate allows for lifelong withdrawals in nearly every market scenario. That means that you should still have money left at the time of your death, even 30 or 50 years hence.

I’m aware that the tone of this advice could seem money-obsessed or money-grubbing. But I don’t say it out of the conviction that the world’s already abundant supply of rich jerks needs adding to. (Parts of this article were written on January 20th, an auspicious day for rich jerks everywhere.)

Rather, I think the dream of financial independence is worth chasing because I’m convinced that freedom is one of the worthiest goals around. If you’re a person with big-time creative dreams, it would be a tragedy straight out of Arthur Miller to spend your life working for someone else—or waiting around for the world to change. We seem to be decades away from instituting a universal basic income. So it might be time for you to try to DIY one.





Identify The Things Most Important To You
It�s important we identify things that are most important to us and spend accordingly. Don�t cheap out on everything on your path to financial freedom! For the most part, I always recommend buying less and focusing on quality over quantity. Having a house full of clutter doesn�t do anybody any good. Further, I�ve never regretted spending up on an experience. Great experiences tend to appreciate with time.

It�s strange, but despite a rising net worth thanks to a raging bull market, I don�t have a desire to buy anything new. I�m content with our cozy home, our one family car, and the scrumptious food we eat every day. Being able to see the best healthcare providers at UCSF for my family is one of the things I�m most happy about. Where I do plan to spend more money on are services to help save time at home. But that will be a topic for another post.



Many of us daydream about retiring early -- and then assume that we can't. It's true that if you're way behind in saving up for retirement, you may have to toil far longer than you'd like. But early retirement is more possible for many people than they think, and Social Security can be a big help toward that end.


Why you might want to -- or have to -- retire early

Since few of us have much of an idea of how long we'll live, it's well worth considering retiring early if you can in order to enjoy as many work-free years as possible. Many people don't even really get to decide just when to retire -- fate decides for them. The 2016 Retirement Confidence Survey found that 46% of retirees left the workforce earlier than planned, with 55% citing health problems or a disability as the reason and 24% citing changes at work such as a downsizing or workplace closure.

Better still, the younger you are when you retire, the more active you can be in retirement, at least in the first bunch of years. If you want to play a lot of tennis or want to take up ballroom dancing lessons or plant a big garden or trek up to Machu Picchu, it will be much easier to do when you're 65 than when you're 75. Early retirees often can enjoy their retirement more, being younger, healthier, and more able to be active, travel, and so on.

Don't jump into an early retirement without being sure you can afford it -- and don't forget to factor in healthcare costs, either, as they can be hefty. But if you can swing it, give early retirement some serious consideration. Social Security lets you start collecting monthly checks at age 62, and that's just what you might want to do





Hello, fellow samurai! I am the Physician on FIRE, a 41-year old anesthesiologist with an 11-year career under my belt. A couple years ago, I realized that early retirement was a distinct possibility for my family and me,

It’s not that I don’t have a good job. In many ways, it’s great, actually. I do work some crazy hours, but I’m rewarded with ample time off. The job can be stressful, but I’m compensated quite well. Among the jobs with six-figure salaries, being a physician is rather highly esteemed. Indeed, there are several aspects of this job that I will miss if I follow through with plans to retire early.

I’m pursuing financial freedom, but I’m essentially trading time for money I don’t need at this point.


It�s perplexing to me why Americans don�t have more in retirement savings given we�ve seen a massive boom in the stock market, bond market, and real estate market for the past�. forever.

If I was a working adult back in 1980, I�d like to think I�d be worth at least $10,000,000 today. Not only would I be worth $10,000,000, so would all my friends. How hard can becoming a deca-millionaire be when the S&P 500 is up over 20X since 1980? Look at all the real estate you could have bought for dirt cheap 40 years ago as well. If only I had a time machine.

The main reason why I think more Americans aren�t doing financially better is due to a lack of education. Why aren�t personal finance fundamentals indoctrinated in kids by the 12th grade, I don�t know. I certainly plan to teach my child about the power of compound returns, saving, investing, asset allocation, and the importance of optionality.




In my case, I learned bad money habits from the start. My parents were poor role models. They taught me that money was meant to be spent. They didn�t save and they didn�t invest. As a result, our family was subject to the whims of fate. We had no protection from bad luck or a bad economy. If my father was out of work, we were out of money.
When I grew up, I made the same poor choices. I followed the same invisible scripts my parents had followed. For a long time, I spent everything I earned. It was a game to see how long I could skate with nothing in my bank account. Worse, I developed a credit-card habit (something my parents had always avoided). Instead of improving my financial blueprint, I was making myself more miserable. (Peck would say that I was suffering from a form of mental illness!)

At the same time, I followed in my father�s entrepreneurial footsteps.
