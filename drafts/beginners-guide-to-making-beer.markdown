Have you ever taken a sip of beer that was so delicious, so refreshing that it made you pause to wonder: Where did this nectar of the gods come from? How could such a beverage be made? Well, living a booming craft beer scene has given me this feeling often in the past years.



Turns out I was wrong. The

there are two things that every homebrewer must be familiar with before making their own beer: the ingredients required and the brewing process.

###The Ingredients Of Beer###

Beer is made up of four main ingredients:

1. **Malt:** Grain that has gone through the "malting" process. This is done by wetting and drying barley, which allows it to begin sprouting. This brings out the precious fermentable sugars that are needed for the brewing process. Malt provides the sugar that the yeast consumes during the brewing process and therefore determines the strength of the beer. Simply put, more malt equals stronger beer.

2. **Hops:** Flowers from the hop vine. They provide bittering, aroma, and additional flavoring. The acids also help preserve the beer. It seems strange why bitterness is added to beer, but this is to balance the sweetness of the malt. Hops provide the bitterness to balance the sweetness in beer. Compared to malt, hops are added in small quantities to beer, even in the bitterest IPAs you’re probably used to tasting. Most home brewers use pellet hops in their brewing as this is a convenient form to store and use.

3. **Yeast:** The magician behind the magic. Yeasts are single-cell micro-organisms that ultimately creates the alcohol. Yeast converts wort (or the unfermented beer) into beer by consuming sugars from the malt and converting them to alcohol and carbon dioxide. Many varieties are available to choose from, each having different effects on the final taste and quality.

Yeast is one of the coolest ingredients you'll ever use in the kitchen. Maybe it's the beer geek coming out in me, but listen to the facts before you judge. First of all, yeast make alcohol. Like a dream, right? Second, they can produce all sorts of diverse flavors, reminiscent of lemons, spices, or butterscoth. And finally, they're not just a raw ingredient, they're actually alive. They're alive when you first add them to the beer, and they're alive when you drink them in the beer a month later. Not many other recipe ingredients can make that claim.

4. **Water:** An obvious, but important ingredient. Water quality is often overlooked in the homebrew process. Many believe using distilled water will avoid unwanted chemicals and minerals. However, some minerals actually *improve* flavor (why some large beer companies such as Budweiser and Coor's are located in the Rockies to access mountain spring water). Typically, most beers are more than 90 percent water by volume. Because of this, make sure you choose your water carefully: If your tap water doesn’t taste good, try using bottled spring water instead.

###How Does That Make Alcohol?###

The basic PROCEDURE for making beer is to allow yeast to eat fermentable sugars. This action produces alcohol and gives off CO2 as a by-product. That is the whole PROCEDURE - yeast eats sugars; produces alcohol and CO2.

First, Malted barley is mixed with hot water, creating the "mash", a mushy oatmeal-like substance. Next a sugary liquid called the wort (pronounced wert) is drained off.
,munteract sweetness of wert), flavor, and aroma. 

Next, yeast is mixed with the hopped wort and siphoned to a separate container to ferment. The yeast converts sugar into ethanol (aka alcohol) and carbon dioxide (adds bubbles to the beer).

###The Brewing Process###


Many different techniques.. understand the PROCEDURE of making beer and develop their own TECHNIQUES that assist the yeast to eat those fermentable sugars, produce alcohol and give off CO2.


CLEANLINESS: You want to have all of your equipment clean and sanitized for brewing.

BOILING THE WORT

COOLING THE WORT: Prior to adding ("pitching") the yeast to the 5 gallons of wort, the temperature needs to be brought down to around 85-90 degrees F. The yeast can't operate at high temperatures, so it is critical to cool the wort prior to pitching. Some brewers use a wort chiller; others allow the covered pot to sit for 4-8 hours to cool naturally. Some general guidance is you want to cool the wort as quickly as possible and get the yeast growing and working quickly. 

TOPPING WATER UP TO 5 GALLONS:

FERMENTING: The wort likes a cool (65-70 degree F) and dark place to ferment.

Tips and Tricks 

Learn your boil-off rate: Boil a fixed amount of water as a test to find out how much water your system loses to evaporation during a boil (it can vary from brewer to brewer with variables such as kettle size and burner output). This will tell you how much wort you need in order to reach your targeted batch size. For instance, if you fill your kettle with 4 gallons of water and boil it for a half hour and find that you're left with 3.5 gallons of water then you know that you're boiling away a half gallon every 30 minutes. A typical 5 gallon batch with a 60 minute boil will require you to start with 6 gallons of wort.

Adjusting the gravity of a beer: If your gravity readings aren't what you're targeting you can add dry malt extract to raise the gravity or add water to lower the gravity. Just make sure that dry malt extract adjustments are added at the beginning of the boil. 





1. All Grain: 
2. Specialty Grains: There are also specialty grains that provide particular color, taste, and sweetness to the home brewer. Some of these include: Crystal, Chocolate, and Black Patent Malts
3. Liquid Malt Extract: This is malt that has been processed by a company and is put into a form that is easily used by a home brewer   .. extract brewers
4. Dried Malt Extract (DME):
5. Corn Sugar: This is a subject of great debate. The yeast needs to eat fermentable sugars in order to produce alcohol and give off CO2. The yeast is not fussy about where those fermentable sugars come from.  Corn Sugar is very handy as a fermentable sugar to use when you bottle your beer. When you jump start them with some priming sugar at bottling (and then cap the bottle), the CO2 that is given off will be trapped in the bottle and provide natural carbonation for your beer.
