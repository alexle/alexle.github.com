Most of us like money because itís an easy way to keep score. If we make over $400,000 a year and have a net worth of over $2,000,000 by age 35, weíre in the top one percent for income and net worth. Hooray!

But money is a pretty meaningless measure after youíve got all your needs taken care of. Further, a rich person is no more special than someone who has less.

After a certain point, the more money you have, the more I question your goodness. In San Francisco, there are people worth hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars, yet they continue to hoard more money than they could ever spend in their lifetime while over 100,000 people are homeless.






Itøs no secret that you can have a lot of money and success and still be miserable. Seeing how people all over the world live and how little we actually need to fulfill our basic needs has shown me that wealth is not just about accruing material goods. While itøs true that pursuing our dreams can be difficult (although not impossible) without any financial resources to get us started, what is the point of having money if we donøt have the time or are too stressed to do anything with it? Treating money as a tool ø rather than just an end goal ø can help us create the time and mind-space pursue the ventures we are passionate about.

I share some tips on how downsizing on material goods and shifting our mindset when it comes to money management can increase our wealth:




15. Obsession with money

I met far too many people who were more interested in their bank balance than their quality of life. People richer than I can possibly imagine, who are depressed. More money seems to be the only way they understand of solving problems. They don't travel because they think they need tens of thousands of dollars (which is just simply not true, as you can read it in this post here),

This rush to the finish line or to have a million dollars in your bank account or to get that promotion, and to have that consume your life is something I find really sad.


We do it over and over againófalling into debt, buying useless crap, churning our investments. Studies show that once we meet our basic needs, making more money won't make us happier, yet we keep panting after it. (And we keep spending itóespecially spending what we don't have.

Focus on time
Don't be that guy. You know: ambitious but unbalanced. Gangbuster career but headed for a breakdown. So how do you outwit money's allure and keep your career on track? 

Well, no. Money often bungles even this simple task. For instance, studies show that the owners of luxury cars are generally no happier driving them than the owners of compacts, and that owning a vacation home has no impact on happiness. "This process of hedonic adaptation sets in. We start taking for granted almost any change in our lives," says Sonja Lyubomirsky, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of California at Riverside. When it comes to satisfaction, she says, you'd do far better buying an experience. "We are the sum total of our experiences," Lyubomirsky says. "People don't define themselves so much in terms of their possessions." 

Score the benefit, not the thing
Instead of purchasing the Mercedes or the Porsche, rent one for a weekendóand drive it hard. Better yet, skip the Porsche and take your nephew to the go-kart track and shred the asphalt all day long for a fraction of the cost. As for the vacation homeówell, it may be fun to think about, but that's because you're not dealing with the flooded basement, the noisy neighbors, and the monthly payments. As with the Porsche, you're better off rentingónot least because you can vacation somewhere new every year and put the money you saved toward, say, guitar lessons. Or perhaps a class in Italian and two tickets to Italy. You might try Puglia, the heel of the boot, where you can still spend a few weeks sipping Primitivo on the Adriatic for the price of some designer shirts. In an accompanying analysis, researchers also concluded that wealthier people were less able to enjoy life's little pleasures.

In other words, they'd become snobs.

The interruption principle has broad implications. "I'd also suggest that instead of buying one big thing, make little purchases over time to repeat that initial enjoyment effect," says Meyvis. Ultimately, savoring is a cognitive tool that's as important as positive thinking or goal setting. It's how you transform products into experiences: anticipating them, engaging them, making them memorable. And insulating them from the numbing effects of money.

If you're not buying experiences, at least spend your money on stuff that can easily convert into experiences. Choose things you can interact with, or things that lead to interaction with others. Food is always a good bet for this reason. If you must have a fancy cooking toy, spend your money on bricks and build a pizza oven in your yard. You'll remember the experience and enjoy reconnecting with old friends. Also, stick to smaller portions of high-quality goods. "The bigger your portions," says Meyvis, "the more you consume, the greater your adaptation, and the less you'll savor." Then learn to enjoy the humble purchases. Don't let your taste for fine wine prevent you from relishing a cold can of Miller on a hot day. If all else fails, reset. "We call it 'revirginizing,'" says Jordi Quoidbach, Ph.D., the lead author of the chocolate study. Depriving yourself of day-to-day pleasures restores your ability to enjoy them. Go camping, or swear off coffee for a weekóand then blow your mind on a double espresso at home.

* Early retirement. All you’ve got to do is save a high portion of your income, grow your financial nut, and build multiple income streams. I’ve seen people who only made $60,000 a year retire well before 60. On the flip side, I know of plenty of people who make multiple six figures a year and can’t afford to retire even after 20 years of such income. Early retirees are willing to sacrifice a little pleasure now for a lot of freedom later. There is no secret to early retirement, only execution.

Search as I might, it was hard to find even a few handful of moments of sheer happiness and pure joy. My life now was a continuous rerun of – wake up, go to work, stress out, get back, eat dinner, work some more or watch TV, stress out some more and repeat it all over again the next day – with a lot of complaining/cursing and a few expensive trinkets/vacations sprinkled in.


Iíd like to give you a specific example of how active income feels better than passive income. Just the other day I scored a small ad deal for $400. After about eight back and forth e-mail negotiations over a couple days I locked it down and was thrilled. I decided to take a friend out for a steak dinner to celebrate to the tune of $140, or 35% of what I made from the deal.

During this time period I got a monthly electronic rental payment of $3,800 from a tenant like clockwork. Youíd think that receiving a sum almost 10X the amount of the ad deal while doing nothing would provide a little more happiness, but I didnít feel a single thing. Nada. Zip. Zero. Mei you. I used the $3,800 to pay my rental mortgage and HOA and still had $2,100 left over to spend on whatever. I saved it of course.

Cementing $400 in an ad deal is a small portion of my online income, but it gives me the most amount of pride because if I didnít do anything, nothing would have happened. Creating something that didnít exist before is one of the greatest feelings ever.


DONíT GET TOO CAUGHT UP IN THE GLORY OF PASSIVE INCOME

Generating enough passive income to live a good life is wonderful. Iím still only half way to my ultimate passive income goal with probably five to ten more years to go. But take it from someone who has seen both sides of the active and passive income spectrum. Youíll get bored of your passive income streams eventually. Youíll long to start generating active income again because it feels so much more rewarding.

I've been meaning to write about this one day. There are some things that change. For example, you learn to distinguish problems that can be solved with money from those that can't. You can buy your way out of a lot of schleps.
Life doesn't get an order of magnitude more enjoyable, because you still can't buy your way out of the most serious types of problems, but a lot of annoyances are removed.
The best part is what I thought would be the best part: not having to worry about money. Before Viaweb I'd been living pretty hand to mouth, doing occasional consulting. It felt like treading water, in the sense that while it wasn't hard, I knew in the back of my mind that I'd drown if I stopped. Getting rich felt like reaching the shore.
One thing you learn when you get rich, though, is how few of your problems were caused by not being rich.
