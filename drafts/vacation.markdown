Don't Wait For Vacation To Enjoy Life

This is a unique perspective that isn‚Äôt included in many retirement planning conversations and one that I hope you‚Äôll take a moment to put it into the context of your life. Time and time again, people at workshops, classes, and webinars get excited about retirement because it‚Äôs finally going to be the time when they‚Äôll get healthy, spend more time with the spouse and grandkids, and reconnect with old friends and/or an organization. My response is, ‚ÄúWhy have you been waiting so long?‚Äù As you might expect, people are surprised by my response and give me that perplexing look, sometimes noting, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I thought it was supposed to be.‚Äù Which is exactly when their previously held notions begin to wear off.


It doesn‚Äôt take retired people long to realize that everything they sacrificed along the road to retirement cannot be quickly or easily regained. Yes, it‚Äôs important to save money and invest regularly, but making retirement one‚Äôs lifelong primary goal is among the quickest ways to end up disappointed once you get there.

 ‚ÄúWhat will I do with 20-30 years in retirement?‚Äù ask ‚ÄúWhat will I regret if I don‚Äôt make it to retirement?‚Äù

 It‚Äôs a simple way to become more in the present and ensure you‚Äôre striking a balance between living for now versus later.

 Set up a ‚Äúdate night‚Äù fund instead of focusing solely on a retirement travel fund. If you and your spouse don‚Äôt like spending time together now, having money in a travel fund a few years later isn‚Äôt going to change that.

 Redirect some savings from that college fund to visiting a quirky camp or taking that cruise the kids have been begging for. It may be a deviation from your typical family vacation and savings plan, but it may be exactly what your family needs to stay close and connected.

 The point I am trying to make is this: Quit worrying about just running out or money! Stop being fearful of using your personal and financial resources to make the best life you can right now. The same stuff that makes for a great retirement can be used now to create a positive and fulfilling life that leads up to it. Now that‚Äôs not permission to abandon everything you are doing to live extravagantly, but instead, an opportunity to acknowledge your present situation, needs and opportunities.



Whatøs the alternative to the reactive, autopilot life of busyness that you recommend for a good life?

Jonathan: Awareness and intention. We need to break the cycle of mindless, reactive living and reclaim a sense of choice, agency and intention. We need to step back into the driverøs seat of our lives. To say, øI get to choose. My days, my years, my life belongs to me. Other peopleøs agendas, stories and will are not the primary driver of where I place my attention, my gifts, my love and energy.ø

If we want to fill our days with activities, experiences and peoples, so be it. But, letøs start making those choices actively and proactively. Mindfully, from a place of filling our lives with connection, vitality and meaning. Not reactively, because weøve never stopped to own the responsibility and the blessing of choice.



 To learn how the rest of the world lives is to cure yourself of spoiling. Americans live better than the vast majority of the world. We should be thankful for clean water, for consistent electricity, for the abundance of choice in our daily lives. Too often, we willfully ignore that. We always want more. More money. More property. More status. For the many privileged among us, our daily lives are so comfortable that we obsess over trivialities to keep our minds occupied. Compare that to the river people of Cambodia or the horse tribes of Mongolia. The attendant absurdities of our privilege are obvious.

A well-traveled person sees his home country's flaws more clearly. She sees the pettiness and divisiveness in the people. She sees the beauty and the benefits, too, but the picture is more complicated. After living abroad, it's hard not to be baffled how a nation as wealthy as ours doesn't seem to mind if a serious health condition can bankrupt almost anyone, or how our prison industrial complex is a perpetual motion machine gobbling up poor people and people of color just to keep itself running.

If you're considering living in another country, here's what people will say before you leave: You'll have experiences that you'll carry with you. You'll learn to see differences in cultures. You'll benefit in ways that you won't expect.

And they're right. It will change you.

But what they won't tell you is that if you come back, you'll want different things out of life than before you left. Home won't look the same anymore. You'll learn that the experiences you gather make you who are. You carry them with you. And that's where they do the most good ó with you.
