Donøt sit on the sidelines. Do something inspirational yourself.
You can sit here all day and listen to me inspire you. You can watch all the inspirational videos that Youtube has to offer. What would be far better is to go out there and inspire people yourself rather than being inspired.

Take the inspiration youøve gathered in your life and do something with it so you can allow others to create their own inspirational journey. Be the example rather than only listening to the example and saying øOne day Iøll do that.ø




I never used to be like that. I used to be numb, more often than not. Unaware of what I was doing, waking up in the morning and lying in bed with my eyes glued to my phone for an hour, instead of even sparing a moment to consider what I wanted my day to be like?ó?or what I wanted out of my week, my month, my year, the decade, my lifeÖit was just living by reacting.

When I came out of the last slump like that, I decided to take a different approach. To wake myself up, and think?ó?every day?ó?about how I was living, what I was doing, what I wanted, who I wanted to be.



Getting old is great because it FORCES us to enjoy life more. What do I mean by this? Many of us are so focused on doing a good job at work, saving as much as we can, and making the right investments that we sacrifice opportunities to experience maximum joy. I've had this problem since graduating from college.

My mantra for so long was "work hard while others are working, and work harder while others are playing." Do this long enough and one day you'll never have to work another day in your life. Before that day comes, however, you may start to wonder why you're trying so hard? It's akin to saving for retirement after you are in retirement. Practically pointless! You don't have to fear running out of money in retirement or if you take a lesser paying job because you are more adaptable than you think.

Getting old has helped me let go. And for those wondering whether you too can start letting go, I'm happy to say that you will once you discern how short life really is. For those who are getting tired of building more wealth, read How To Live Like The One Percent Without Being Rich. It might just provide you the shortcut you're seeking.


Ignoring the world around you.

"I tell my kids every couple of days to look up. We live in the mountains and it's the most beautiful place on earth, but it's so easy to get caught up in everyday deadlines, chores, work that we forget to look around us and appreciate everything we have that's great."



We want to get out of debt, but continue to spend money on unneeded things. We want to get in shape, but never make the changes in our diet or exercise habits to accomplish that. We want to start saving for retirement, but never pursue the answers we need to get started. We desire to start a business or change jobs, but continue to spend our evenings and weekends watching television.

Or how about this one? We desire to live in a clutter-free home, but continue finding reasons why we need to keep all the stuff around us.

In each case, what we say we want is different from what we actually pursue.

Again, saying you want something is one thing, doing something about it is very different. We prove what we desire most by our actions, not by our words.




You see, every time you lose focus, try to multi-task, or take a break to answer emails or texts in the middle of a human interaction, you‚Äôre robbing yourself of the experience of that very moment.

You never get that back.

Over time, that makes it nearly impossible to appreciate the tiny little moments that add up to big time life.

What‚Äôs more, that kind of absentminded behavior can spill over into a lot of other areas of your life, including your business.

And do you really want to be making decisions about your business when you aren‚Äôt completely focused?

Didn‚Äôt think so.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs absolutely crucial you master what I call the ‚Äúart of right now.‚Äù

there‚Äôs an art to being able to live right now, in the moment.

Whether you‚Äôre with family or having an important meeting, really paying attention to what‚Äôs going on in that moment‚Äîinstead of worrying about the next‚Äîwill make you a better person and a better entrepreneur.

Let‚Äôs start out with what it doesn‚Äôt: Contrary to popular belief, living in the moment doesn‚Äôt mean making selfish decisions just because you can, or doing something because it fills a short-term void.

In actuality, people who really understand the ‚Äúart of right now‚Äù are people who feel truly content with what they are doing at the moment they‚Äôre doing it.

For example, the art of right now means that if you‚Äôre having a cup of coffee, you should just enjoy the cup of coffee.

Don‚Äôt try to drink the coffee, check your phone and have a Skype conference call, all at the same time.

You can waste your life waiting for a fairy tale.  Life does not have to be perfect to be very enjoyable.  Living life to the fullest is not about living life perfectly.  It is about making the most out of every day living.

When you keep waiting for the ideal fairy tale situation to arrive, you let a lot of great things pass you by in the process.  The one thing we can‚Äôt make more of is time.  Once time has slipped away it is gone and it cannot be recovered.

Relief Doesn‚Äôt Work
This is what most people do when they experience stress and worry:

Take it out on your partner of family
Drink alcohol, take drugs, or both
Binge-watch Netflix
Play video games
Go on a holiday
Party all night
Have sex
Be honest, how long do these things make you forget about your worries? 10 minutes, half hour, a day? It doesn‚Äôt last. As soon as you get back to the reality of your life‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääworry and stress smack you in the face.

Distracting yourself from your life doesn‚Äôt work‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand yet, many of us keep doing it


BUT this was okay, because I thought‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHey, I am so great, I spend my time learning instead of wasting it on social media like the rest of the world‚Äù,

OR

‚ÄúLook at me, I always know what‚Äôs happening out there, I am on the front-line keeping up to date, unlike the rest of the world.‚Äù




You have to go out and make the best of every circumstance in your life by investing yourself fully in it.  This is a much better approach than waiting and waiting for the ideal situation that is likely never to arrive.

I‚Äôm partly to blame. I get distracted. I‚Äôm in the middle of an email‚Äîa work email‚Äîand suddenly I‚Äôm online looking at a Pinterest board of remodeled farmhouses or an article on ¬≠Hillary 2016 or a video on Funny or Die, none of which is getting me any closer to replying to hundreds of unanswered emails or finishing a draft for a deadline that has come and gon
