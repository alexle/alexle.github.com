Tell me, what else should I have done?
Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?
Tell me, what is it you plan to do
with your one wild and precious life?
- Mary Oliver

Today can be as great as you want it to be.

Your fate isn’t set. You get to decide how much of yourself you’re going to put into today.

Rather than saying, “Well, we’ll see what happens,” you must powerfully state, “Today, I’m going to make it happen!”

When you go into the gym, you get to decide how hard you’re going to work out. But one thing is for certain, you’ll feel far better if you walk out 30-60 minutes later having given it everything you’ve got.

The same goes with your day.


Every week, you should be trying to do something you’ve never done before. You should be elevating your game. It shouldn’t look the same as last week. Hence, the weekly planning sessions. What are you going to strive for this week that will change the game for you?

Are you experimenting, or just going through the motions?

Are you courageously embracing fear and risk?

Are you humbly embracing further education?

If not, you’re plateau’d. And in many ways, it doesn’t really matter what you do with your days. You could do the same thing every day and not get any better.





7. Be present
We’re so focused on our goals that we forget to enjoy the present moment. This is one of my biggest pitfalls.

I really need to remind myself EVERY SINGLE day that I should enjoy the now.

We’re always waiting until we achieve something. “I will be happy then.”

Nope, you won’t if you’re always stuck in the future. Find a trigger that brings you back to the present moment.

For example, I recently bought a new watch. During the same time, I was reading a lot about this spiritual stuff. Now, every time I look at my watch, I say, “What time is it? NOW.”





What’s one powerful piece of advice for living a fulfilling life?
Get clear on what you want.

People who always hesitate, can’t make up their mind, and who are all over the place, will be left behind.

Decide what you want. And be firm with your execution. Don’t deviate from the path. For nothing and no one. If others can’t accept that, they are not the right people in your life.

What’s your definition of life in 50 words?
No one knows what they are doing.

That’s life in 7 words. And it’s something I truly believe in. It’s what keeps me sane.

In the past, I always believed that everybody had it more figured out than me. But it turns out that no one has definite answers to the biggest challenges in life.

Why are we here? What’s the meaning of life? What should you do?

No one knows. We can all guess! And that’s what a lot of people do. I’m the same. However, we must know that everyone you see around you is no different from you.

That means we’re all the same. We’re trying to figure things out. That’s precisely what this article was about.







4. Alive time vs dead time.

This is a concept from Robert Greene. It’s an intuitive idea. ‘Alive time’ = time spent working towards your goals, creating, improving yourself. ‘Dead time’ = time spent waiting for the future, procrastinating, being miserable. When I am trapped in an unpleasant situation, I ask myself: will this be alive time or dead time? How can I turn this into something useful?

A dull commute = an opportunity to meditate and calm down in preparation for the day. A shitty job = an opportunity to figure out what you actually want to do. A delayed flight = an opportunity to strike up a conversation with a fellow traveler. A tedious assignment = an opportunity to listen to a podcast and learn something.

Alive time is not something which only happens during favorable circumstances. Plenty of people throughout history have turned horrendous experiences into something beneficial. Jean-Dominique Bauby described how he used his mind to escape his paralyzed body; “my diving bell becomes less oppressive, and my mind takes flight like a butterfly.”



You’re just going to keep working, aren’t you?

You’re going to keep slaving away, buy more and bigger things, believing that, at some point, you’ve made it.

Made what, exactly?

Made other people look up to you?

Made the monkey finally leap off of your back and onto someone else’s?

Made a complete mess of your life?

Too often, we live according to other people’s ideas of success. Until, just too late, we realize what we’ve been doing.





1.  Opportunity is only ever found in the present.
Some people wait all day for 5pm, all week for Friday, all year for the holidays, all their lives for happiness and peace.  Donøt be one of them.  Life is too short.  Time is running out.  Donøt wait until your life is almost over to realize how good it has been.  The secret to happiness and peace is letting this moment be what it is, instead of what you think it should be, and then making the very best of it.

If you donøt allow yourself to move past what happened, what was said, what was felt, you will look at your present and future through that same dirty lens and nothing will be able to focus your foggy judgment.  Realize this.  What you do now matters more than what happened yesterday.


2.  Your entire life can be customized from day to day.
There are hundreds of people in every town on Earth who live their entire lives on the default settings, never realizing they can customize everything.  Donøt be one of them.  Donøt settle for the default settings in life.

Find your loves, your talents, your passions, and embrace them.  Donøt hide behind other peopleøs decisions.  Donøt let others tell you what you want, or what you are capable of.  Explore the unknown!  Test the limits!  Design YOUR journey every step of the way.  The life you create from doing something that moves and excites you is far better than the life you get from sitting around wishing you were doing it.


3.  The willingness to do hard things makes life worth living.
If you want a job, be ready to work.  If you want a relationship, be ready to work.  If you want a family, be ready to work.  If you want happiness, be readyø To learn and earn and give and grow, NOT just want and have and take and show.

Truth be told, one of the most important abilities you can develop in life is the willingness to accept and grow through lifeøs challenges and discomforts.  Because the best things are often hard to come by, at least initially.  And if you shy away from hard work and discomfort, youøll miss out on them entirely.  Mastering a new skill is hard.  Building a business is hard.  Writing a book is hard.  A marriage is hard.  Friendship is hard.  Parenting is hard.  Staying healthy is hard.  But all are amazing and worth every bit of effort you can muster.





Clearly, it is common to spend a lot of time thinking about time, and how we are spending time, and the quality of the time we are spending. But no matter the benefits of morning or night, no matter one’s preference about lunch — which is the worst meal, make no mistake — the minutes we spend moving through them are minutes truly spent. And then you’re dead.

We will rarely work to our full potential, we will rarely feel awake enough or tired enough. A sandwich will never be as good as their fans claim they are, and a lunch plan will always feel, in several ways, depressing. But we’re here anyway. So we can only enjoy it. The times of day, the seasons. There are things to be found and to savor, even if you dislike, say, winter, or, say, morning. There is at least the coming in from the cold; there is at least the pink sunrise. It is very beautiful, really. And then we die.




Meditate (briefly) on the shortness of your life. Finally, you might try reminding yourself that death is coming. That might sound morbid and unnecessarily dark, but it’s a certain fact. We only have a limited amount of time left, and we don’t know how much that is. We like to pretend that it’s forever, but it’s certainly not. If you only have a year left, how do you want to spend it? If you have limited time left, how do you want to spend today? Forgetting about what’s important and being distracted? Or pouring yourself into meaningful work and connecting your heart to what you truly care about?
With this precious day that you’ve been given as a gift … show up fully committed. Show up fully devoted to the people you care about. Show up with fierce love that is a gift to all those around you. Show up with full loving appreciation for those you’re connected to, and for the gift of this moment.








DeRozan aims to rewrite that last part of his bio.

“Every day that goes by, my days in this league are getting limited,” he says. “And you want to maximize and take full advantage of everything, of being able to compete for a championship. Because if you were to ask me my rookie year if I would look up 10 years later and this is where I’d be, I wouldn’t believe it.

“So now it’s about putting everything that I’ve learned, everything I went through, that I’ve accomplished, my fails, my sacrifices, just putting all that together and understanding that it’s time to lay it all out there on the line. Because when it’s time to hang it up, I want to have no regrets.”

DeRozan makes it clear he wants to focus on moving forward instead of reliving what took place in Toronto. He doesn’t want to discuss his struggles with depression, although the new Spur says he’s “feeling great” mentally. But DeRozan acknowledges that fully focusing on what’s next is impossible without overcoming the pain he endured this summer. Asked if he’s hurt by what happened in Toronto and whether he sees it as a motivating force, DeRozan doesn’t hesitate.


“It’s there to remind me how brief life is, and how important the time we have here is, “It’s about the importance of leaving a mark and making a deposit in people’s lives in a way that matters,” Cousins says. “In other words, when you have an understanding that life is coming to an end someday, and that we only have so many days? There’s wisdom in that.” For Cousins, it was important to transform the verse into a visual reminder: 720 stones.

“Let’s say I live to 90, that would be a pretty good run,” he says. “We went month to month, and we added it all up, and it was 720 stones because I turned 30 this year. “Every month I’m going to take out a stone, put it in my pocket, and think: ‘Once this month is over, this is gone. You can’t get it back, it’s gone for good.’”

The stone for each month represents the amount of time he likely has left, but it also serves as a reminder to Cousins on how he is spending that time, both on and off the field. “Like everybody else, I am naturally selfish, and so I’m going to think about myself,” he says. “And I think at the end of my life, it’s not going to be about what I did for myself, but what I did for others. Maybe it’s staying after practice to do hand signals with the guys to help them get caught up to speed. To make it about others — I think that’s what leadership is all about, quarterbacking is all about.” As Cousins removes a stone each month, the feel of it in his palm is a reminder of the time passing. But it’s the questions that come with each stone that perhaps carry more weight.

“What impact are you making, not only today, but for eternity? What impact are you making to leave a legacy?” he says.

He pauses.

“It’s just a healthy reminder, make life about other people, invest in other people, knowing that in the end, that’s a life well-lived,” he says.

You get home from work, eat dinner, clean up, flop on the couch, and doze off watching TV or mess with your phone. Then you repeat the same routine Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Before you know it, you’ve hit the weekend, and it felt like all you did all week was work.

In reality, you had an hour or two to do whatever you wanted each night. But because you didn’t consciously invest that time in meaningful or satisfying activities, every day felt like a grind.

So how do you shake up this routine and begin to invest your time in activities that truly satisfy and refresh you?


3. Did I further my vision by at least one percent today?
This question is valuable because it allows you to get into a state of abundance and gratitude. One potential and underrated risk of ambition is neglecting to acknowledge the progress that has been made.

Without awareness of where you've been and where you currently are, it's easy to lose perspective which leads to your self-worth potentially being affected. To prevent this, pause nightly and acknowledge the growth that has already happened.

For example, you wrote 1000 words today toward your book. That's a success and places you at least one percent closer to the goal of a completed book.

Daily incremental progress is how momentum is given birth which leads to monumental feats down the road.



4. What are my three biggest rocks to complete tomorrow?
Without creating a plan of what to focus on for the next day, you run the risk of doing busy work instead of meaningful work.

Identifying your three big rocks for the next day allows you to have direction, clarity, and diffuse any potential feelings of overwhelm.

To identify your biggest rocks for tomorrow, ask yourself "If I don't get anything else done tomorrow, what are three actions that could move me closer to my vision and goals?"




People complain that they’re “too busy.” But are they? Consider this statistic: on average, people spend 50 minutes per day on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. That’s over a day per month! I’m not suggesting you quit social media. In fact, social media can be great if you use it the right way and I’ve seen the first-hand benefits with building a community around my career-related cartoons. Rather, the key is moderation, not deprivation. Spend more time on yourself, instead. The internet is the world’s best library. If there’s something you want to learn, there’s a course, article, or video on it. All you need is the time to go through it.



I don’t know if I would go that far, but I do think he is on to something very important. For starters, how can you ever expect to be where you want to be in three years if you don’t start thinking, planning and talking about it now? Is that really something we want to leave to chance?

So let me ask you the Dan Sullivan question: If you and I were to meet three years from today, what would you want to have happened for you, personally and professionally, in order to consider those years a success?


The Most Important Asset in Your Life øMoney isnøt the most important thing in the world. Your time is.ø Our time is limited, and the prevailing wisdom is that the more we have of it, the more opportunities there are for us to experience joy and fulfillment.

But is that the whole story? Is time really what adds more to life?

Iød argue otherwise. The most important asset in your life isnøt time, but attention. The quality of the experiences in your life doesnøt depend on how many hours there are in the day, but in how the hours you have are used.

You can spend 80 years of a life with as much free time as you want and still not get out of it as much as someone who only lived for 40 years but managed to appropriately direct attention to the things that mattered to them.

Although time is indeed limited, with attention, it can be diluted to expand beyond what most other people get out of the same quantity.




Learn to enjoy the ride, have fun, and appreciate the gift that is the present moment. Right here, right now because øthis is it.ø

If you get anything from this ø you need less than you think to be happy.

ø And isnøt that the goal anyways?

As long as you have good health, good friends, and enough money to cover the necessities, youøre successful and you have more than enough to be happy and live an incredible life.




We scrutinize and dramatize the insignificant annoyances in our lives until we’re blue in the face, and then we sit back and scratch our heads in bewilderment of how unfulfilling and empty life feels.

But the older we grow, the quieter we tend to become, and the less pointless drama, distraction, and busyness we tend to engage in.  Life humbles us gradually as we age.  We begin to realize just how much nonsense we’ve wasted time on.  And we begin to refocus our attention on what truly matters.

1.  Treating your very limited time each day with care.

As time passes, you naturally have more of it behind you and less of it in front of you.  The distant future, then, gradually has less value to you personally.  But that doesn’t really matter, because the good life always begins right now, when you stop waiting for a better one.  Some people wait all day for 5pm, all week for Friday, all year for the holidays, all their lives for happiness.  But you don’t have to be one of them.  Don’t wait until your life is almost over to realize how good it has been.

Over the past decade, Angel and I have gradually learned to pay more attention to the beauty and practicality of living a simpler life.  A life uncluttered by most of the meaningless drama, distraction, and busyness people fill their lives with, leaving us with space for what’s truly meaningful.  A life that isn’t constant rushing, worrying and stress, but instead contemplation, creation, and connection with the people and projects that matter most to us.

By redefining our priorities, and building healthy rituals to back them up, we’ve literally been able to change our lives.  And this is now a healthy practice we coach our course students though every single day as well.

If you’ve been feeling overwhelmed and stressed out a lot lately, I highly recommend you rethink how you’re spending your time, and replace the meaningless with the meaningful.

Start by being honest about the drama, distraction, and busyness in your life…



Ten years from now, it wonøt really matter what shoes you wore today, how your hair looked, or what brand of clothes you wore.  What will matter is how you lived, how you loved, and what you learned along the way.

Deep down you know this already, right?

Yet today, just like the majority of us, you are easily distracted and derailed by the insignificant.

You give too much of your time to meaningless time-wasters.

You step through days, skeptically, with inner resistance.

You take your important relationships for granted.

You get caught up in hurtful drama.


But the older we grow, the more focused we tend to become, and the less pointless drama, distraction and busyness we engage in.  Life humbles us gradually as we age.  We begin to realize just how much nonsense weøve wasted time on.  And we begin to adjust our focus toward whatøs truly important.



Stop Relying On ‘Life-Changing’ Conferences  Even with all the great content out there, you have to remember: it’s not enough to consume it. You have to absorb it. Practice it. Live it. No self-help book will change your life. Nor will a single keynote speech or conference. Many of these resources promise to change your life forever! To unlock your potential! To 10X your growth! But the truth is that none of it matters unless you take action. There’s no silver bullet. Even with all the information out there, it’s up to you to implement and learn. If you do, it’ll go a long way in impressing employers. It’ll show that you’re a self-starter who is willing to learn independently.


Weøre 100% responsible for our experience of life. We may not control our external circumstances, but we can choose how we experience and respond to them.

Taking 100% responsibility frees us ø it empowers us to take action and shape our lives. Avoiding responsibility traps us ø it leaves us as helpless passengers who just watch as our lives unfold. What aspect of your life do you want to take more responsibility for shaping?

Tomorrowøs not promised. Every time that I hear or read that someone unexpectedly has passed away ø say due to brain cancer or a freak accident ø I feel deep sadness. Itøs a life story abruptly cut short.

Iøm then reminded of Steve Jobs and how he would look in the mirror every morning and ask himself, øIf today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?ø If the answer is ønoø too many days in a row, itøs time to ask, øWhat needs to change?ø




in 10 years, are you going to remember the day you came in to work over the weekend? or will you remember when you shoed up to your son's soccer game?



You need to put first things first, every single day.

You have to pay the price.

If you’re willing to pay the price, you can have absolutely anything you want.

But you need to be uncomfortable enough with your current situation to get off Facebook. To stop consuming and wasting your time.

To focus on learning and creating rather than being entertained and distracted.

There are probably dozens are recurring activities you do on a daily basis that aren’t serving you.

You need to drop those activities from your life. Leave them in your past and fill your future with the activities that will take you to where you really want to go.

When you have 5 extra minutes, what do you do? Do you entertain and distract yourself? Or do you pay the price?

When your alarm goes off in the morning, do you hit the snooze button or do you pay the price?

When you know you should be creating, do you distract yourself or do you pay the price?

When you’re with your loved ones, do you look at your smart phone or do you pay the price?

Are you serious or still pretending?

Do you really want it or are you still unsure?

Are you moving one step in 20 directions or 20 steps in one direction?

How many hours did you waste today? How many hours were you paying the price?

What do you really want?

Are you willing to pay the price?

Nothing in life is free, especially your time. Everything has a cost. And when it comes to your time, the cost is heavy. You can never get even one second back.

You can live your life on purpose. You can spend your time on things you value. You can be who you intended to become. You can continue to progress and evolve, even after you’ve become successful and fulfilled.

But the price must be payed.




Being too busy impressing others and forgetting about what matters to YOU. — Ten years from now it won’t really matter what shoes you wore today, how your hair looked, or what brand of clothes you wore.  What will matter is how you lived, how you loved, and what you learned along the way.  So forget about impressing people for the sake of it.  Be real instead!  If you want to impress someone, impress yourself by making progress on something you’re sincerely proud of.  Focus on what matters!  It’s truly amazing what you can accomplish in a day when you aren’t incessantly worried about what everyone else in the world is thinking and doing.  Just show yourself that you can grow and get better.  It’s never about impressing or competing with others.  In the end, it’s just you vs. you




Being too busy to appreciate your life. — Take action, work hard, but don’t forget to pause and pay attention to life’s little moments too.  That’s honestly the best advice there is.  Realize that life is simply a collection of little chances for happiness, each lived one moment at a time.  That some time each day should be spent noticing the beauty in the space between the big events.  That moments of dreaming and sunsets and refreshing breezes cannot be bettered.  But most of all, realize that life is about being present, watching and listening and working without a clock and without anticipation of results at every moment, and sometimes, on really good days, for letting these little moments fill your heart with intense gratitude.  Truth be told, you will inevitably, whether tomorrow or on your deathbed, come to wish that you had spent less time worrying and rushing through your life, and more time actually being mindful and appreciative of each day.





One of the biggest mysteries in modern day life is something that we’re all guilty of.
Please answer me this: Why do we work 8–9 hours a day so that we can earn free time, while we endlessly waste that hard-earned free time?

Have you ever looked at it this way? It’s an absurd way of living. And yet, everyone with a traditional job lives that way. I thought about how I invested my time: About two and a half hours on the train each day, working a job I wasn’t passionate about and spending my free time drinking in the pub with co-workers, watching TV shows or gossiping at work.

We all work hard to earn two things: Money and free time that we can spend on leisure activities. Sounds pretty normal, right? But shitty part is that we end up wasting that time on bullshit activities. We work hard to earn free time — but we can’t do anything with it because we’re too tired.

That’s how I felt. When you have a life that only drains energy, there’s not much left in your tank during the evenings and weekends.

That’s the one thing you want to avoid at all cost. It is simply not worth it to give all your energy to earn money and time if you can’t use it.




Of course, we all want to live an awesome life. But most of us are so comfortable in our everyday routine that we often don’t fulfil our potential. The reason why we don’t push ourselves to be better than average could be because of lack of perseverance, avoiding failure or a lost sense of urgency.

Our time is valuable. Life is too short to be mediocre. And everyone knows that stagnation is decline. In order live a better life you must become the best version of yourself. But how?



We are wired to be outside, not cooped up in front of a screen comparing our lives to everyone else's highlight reels.


How to Make Your Work Matter
øThe goal of life is not to relax on the beach, sipping mojitos all day. The purpose is to find something you love that adds value to the world.ø -Benjamin Foley
Iøm not here to tell you you need to love every minute of your job for your life to be øsuccessful.ø In his book The Entrepreneur Roller Coaster, author Darren Hardy proposed he doesnøt like his job up to 95% of the time!








I want to be 100% financially independent and own my own business. I want to make enough money to be able to travel through Europe whenever I want. I want to be healthy and fit and spend lots of time cycling and playing basketball. I want an amazing marriage. I want deep friendships with my loved ones.



For most people, the stakes simply aren’t high enough.

There’s not enough reason to get up early and work, get off Facebook, or get into shape.

Put most simply, most people don’t have a compelling enough why. If they did, their whole life would be different. Life, apparently, isn’t worth giving everything they’ve got.


2. Beware of drift.


Rusty Lofgren/Shutterstock.com
“Drift” is the decision we make by not deciding, or by making a decision that unleashes consequences for which we don’t take responsibility.

You go to medical school because both your parents are doctors. You get married because all your friends are getting married. You take a job because someone offers you that job. You want the respect of the people around you, or you want to avoid a fight or a bout of insecurity, or you don’t know what else to do, so you take the path of least resistance.

The word “drift” has overtones of laziness or ease. Not true! Drift is often disguised by a huge amount of effort and perseverance. For me, law school was drift, and it was hard every step of the way, from the LSAT to my clerkship with Justice Sandra Day O’Connor to the New York Bar exam. In the end, I’m happy I did go to law school - and that’s another tricky thing about drift. Sometimes drift does make you happy. But don’t count on it.





There’s a difference between what we say and what we do. It’s called reality.
We say a lot of things:
“I don’t want to be that guy who can’t climb two flights of stairs.”
“I want to have a close family.”
“I want to help and inspire people.”
“I want to buy a house for my parents.”
There’s nothing wrong with that. Most of us have nothing but good intentions.
However, good intentions mean nothing. You can’t pay your bills with good intentions. We know that making a living is hard. And living a great life is even more difficult.
So every day we hustle, work hard, and do our best to get closer to our dreams.






You get about 30,000 days and then youøre done. And youøve already used up a good portion of them. Death puts life into focus. But we ignore death, so we lose track of whatøs important. Of priorities. Of the big picture. Of whatøs meaningful. We even lose track of whatøs fun. Friends donøt get seen and vacation days donøt get used. We donøt acknowledge that thereøs an end and so we donøt prioritize and we waste time ø and not even in ways that are truly enjoyable. Well, I think thatøs scarier than death. When Karl Pillemer of Cornell University studied 1200 people age 70 to 100+, what was the main lesson the older folks wanted to convey to all of us whippersnappers? I would say lesson number one, endorsed by almost all of these 1,200 people, and one in which people tended to be rather vehement, is øLife is short.ø øThey want to pound this awareness into young people, not to depress them, but to encourage them to make better choices. In the field of gerontology, there is a whole theory called øsocioemotional selectivity theory.ø What they argue is that the one thing that makes people different at 70 and beyond, from younger people, developmentally, is a sense of limited time horizon. You become really aware that your days are numbered. Rather than that being so depressing, people start to make better choices. When weøre aware of the quantity, we improve the quality. Now the Stoic philosopher Seneca didnøt feel life was short ø but he came to a conclusion that still jibes with what Karl found: Itøs not that we have too short a time to live, but that we squander a great deal of it. Life is long enough, and itøs given in sufficient measure to do many great things if we spend it well. But when itøs poured down the drain of luxury and neglect, when itøs employed to no good end, weøre finally driven to see that it has passed by before we even recognized it passing. And so it is ø we donøt receive a short life, we make it so. So what should we do? Live a month like itøs your last. Thatøs what happiness researcher Sonja Lyubomirsky thinks might be the solution. Donøt imagine you have terminal cancer ø imagine youøre going to move far away from your job, your friends, your family, your life as you know it now. When an end is in sight, we appreciate things more: Previous research hints that this exercise should prompt us to appreciate in a profound way what we are preparing to give up. When we believe that we are seeing (or hearing, doing, or experiencing) things for the last time, we will see (or hear, do, or experience) them as though itøs the first time. Far from being painful, knowing thereøs an end makes life richer.


You will spend a lot of time and effort on something in life. You can resent it and half-ass it and just get by ø or you can commit to it, build it, jump in with both feet ø and reap great rewards. Donøt tolerate your struggles; embrace them. Direct them towards a goal and forge meaning from them.

These are four harsh truths that will make you a better person: Youøre going to die: You have a deadline. Literally. So focus on what matters. And make sure to celebrate the good times. Iød rather have a shorter awesome life than a long, lousy one. Anything worthwhile takes more work than you think: Ever futz around an entire Sunday, not truly having fun and not truly accomplishing anything? And then you say, øWhat the heck did I do all day?ø Well, you donøt want to be saying that about your life. Embrace the challenges and find meaning.





embrace the brevity of life for what it is, and savor it


"You see something like that, you definitely have a better appreciation for life, and you take every moment in and can't take anything for granted," McCaffrey said before the Panthers departed for their last break before training camp. "We had a little decompression time after that where we just looked at life, and you realize it can really be gone in a split second, and you have to appreciate every single moment."

What happened on that hike made such an impression on McCaffrey that he has shared it with running backs coach Jim Skipper and teammates, and he hasn't hesitated to say it's the most unusual thing that has happened during an offseason in which he got a new offensive coordinator and is adjusting to a new scheme.

"It does remind you how fickle life can be," Skipper said. "There ain't no guarantee of tomorrow."

øOnly those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can goø. - T. S. Eliot

Lindley Chambers, chairman of the Trail Running Association, says the ever-growing contrast between our normal, sedate lives and the feeling you get in an ultra of being fully alive and on the edge is key to the sportøs growing appeal. As the world becomes ever more sanitised and automated, where even cars drive themselves, a deep stirring grows to get out of our comfort zone, to feel something of our wilder selves. øAs our regular, mundane lives become ever more sedentary,ø he says, øwe have a need for something more.ø. most people would be better off with more pain in their lives






Itøs clear that many adults donøt feel they have a lot of time, but these relationships are not going to develop just by wanting them. You have to prioritize time with people.ø




Principle #4: The Vast Majority of Short-Term Pleasures Fade Quickly Into Nothingness
Can you remember what you did for fun a month ago? What about a year ago?

I know that I went out to eat at least once in the last month or so, but I honestly donøt remember the meal or where we even ate. I know at some point in the last few weeks, I picked up a breakfast burrito because I was really hungry and driving somewhere. I canøt really remember if it was good or not or even for sure where I bought it. Were those choices really an effective use of my money? No, not really. Theyøre just forgotten, money that just floated out of my fingers.

I often find things that Iøve purchased in the past, barely used or not used at all. Sometimes, I donøt even remember buying them. Did I get this as a gift? Did I buy this at some point? I really canøt remember at all.

Sometimes, Iøll look through credit card receipts and find little expenses, like $6 spent at a gas station or $10 spent at Target, and I literally donøt remember what I spent that money on. What did I even buy? Why? It was some momentary pleasure that was forgotten almost as soon as I spent the money.

Many pleasures slip right through our fingers ø entertainment products we donøt use, forgettable movies, an expensive latte that we gulp down and forget, overpriced meals gobbled down in a hurry, dinners at mediocre forgettable restaurants, and so on. We spend money on something thatøs pleasurable in the moment, but we almost completely forget about it within days.

Yet, we continue to pay the opportunity cost for those expenses. Since we have less money put aside for the future, weøre more prone to worry and stress about unexpected expenses and about retirement ø and what if one of those bad events actually happens? Furthermore, weøre not making much progress toward our positive goals, either ø thereøs less saved for that dream vacation, for example.

That stress and worry persists. Is it really worth having that momentary pleasure, the thing you forget practically as soon as itøs bought or consumed, when it causes that continuation of stress and worry and that distance between where you are and where you want to be?

Most of those forgettable pleasures really donøt have a lot of upside outside of the next few minutes. Make sure theyøre really worth it.




The desire for more ø and for freedom.

Have you ever said to yourself ø is this all there is? You go to school for all those years to get up, get ready for work, get stuck in traffic, work a job you may or may not like, and go home. Then, you repeat the process on a daily basis until you (hopefully) get to retire.

I know Iøve had days like that. Fortunately, those of us who feel this way are in good company. Nerney and McManus felt the same way about their jobs.

øI was working full-time as a personal trainer at the time and Lauren was working full-time as an accountant,ø explained Nerney. øWe felt frustrated and indentured to our jobs. We felt like we were trading our hours for dollars and that our time was not our own.ø

attention is a resource, be careful how you spend it .. at the end of your days, your life would have been what you paid attention to .. deciding how that vital resource is spent, is key to life, is key to doing and having a life you think is meaningful



The most important asset in your life isn’t time, but attention.

The quality of the experiences in your life doesn’t depend on how many hours there are in the day, but in how the hours you have are used. You can spend 80 years of a life with as much free time as you want and still not get out of it as much as someone who only lived for 40 years but managed to appropriately direct attention to the things that mattered to them.

The world is designed against you

One of the biggest problems of our generation is that while the ability to manage our attention is becoming increasingly valuable, the world around us is being designed to steal away as much of it as possible.

Attention can guide you to a fulfilled life by forcing focus onto the things that really matter to you, rather than the things that steal you away.

Happiness, productivity, presence, and fulfillment all find their roots in your ability to proactively control where you direct your mental energy.

Although the world around us is working harder and harder to take it away from us, with awareness, practice, and the right habits, we can fight back, and we can take control of our own minds.

If you protect and cultivate your attention, there is almost nothing stopping you from living the life you want because that’s where it all begins.



I can be focused and so can you.
Iøm typically all over the shop. 2017 brought a real focus on minimalism and I used this life hack in every aspect of my day-to-day living. At the end of it all, the new focus I created gave me:

ø More time
ø Fewer material belongings
ø Higher quality relationships with my family, friends and colleagues
ø More money
ø Outstanding results in blogging


Focus is not about being more productive; itøs about doing less.

øSubtract all the noise and what youøll be left with is a phenomenal sense of focus that you can use to achieve your big goalsø
If my noisy, disorganized mind can become focused then so can yours. Try subtracting.


Get up early

Unless you’re a morning person, getting up earlier than usual can take you way out of your comfort zone. However, if you get up well before you have to start getting ready for work, it’s worth it. It gives you an opportunity to collect your thoughts and mentally prepare yourself for the day ahead, rather than just dashing from one activity to another. It also gives you the opportunity to eat a good breakfast and exercise, both of which have well-known health benefits.


Many people are just going through life.

Just like that. Passing through. Letting time tick away. Fast.

Letting things happen. Letting every day be just like the day before and the day after. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Nothing you read about in history books. Nothing unique. Just average.


That's why setting priorities is so, so important.

Nowadays, most people want to have great relationships, but they (literally) can't keep from looking at their phones for five minutes to have a conversation.

They want to do great work, but they spend day in and day out going from one meeting to the next, answering calls, writing emails--leaving no time to actually, you know...

Do great work.

They create a mental checklist of things they want to do...

Like, travel.

Or learn a new skill.

Or play more with the kids.

But after years of too much talk and not enough action, that checklist becomes a bucket list...usually, one that never gets fulfilled.

It's so easy to simply drift through life. To let other people dictate your priorities.

To know deep down what's really important, but never take the time to follow through.

Don't do that.

But how do you break the cycle? How do you lead a more fulfilling life?

It all starts by asking a single question:

What's most important?

Think deeply before you answer.

Then, act accordingly.








What about the world is it that excites you? What do you not like about it?

How much of your ideal life are you living? If a lot, what could go wrong?



Life is busy. It can feel impossible to move toward your dreams. If you have a full-time job and kids, itøs even harder.

How do you move forward?

If you donøt purposefully carve time out every day to progress and improveøøøwithout question, your time will get lost in the vacuum of our increasingly crowded lives. Before you know it, youøll be old and witheredøøøwondering where all that time went.

As play-write, Meredith Willson, saidøøøøYou pile up enough tomorrows, and youøll find you are left with nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays.ø

The famed artist, Pablo Picasso, said something strikingly similar: øOnly put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone.ø

Rethinking Your Life and Getting Out of Survival Mode
This article is intended to challenge you to rethink your entire approach to life. The purpose is to help you simplify and get back to the fundamentals.

Sadly, most peopleøs lives are filled to the brim with the non-essential and trivial. They donøt have time to build toward anything meaningful.

They are in survival mode. Are you in survival mode?

Like Bilbo, most of us are like butter scraped over too much bread. Unfortunately, the bread is not even our own, but someone elseøs. Very few have taken the time to take their lives into their own hands.

It was social and cultural to live our lives on other peopleøs terms just one generation ago. And many millennials are perpetuating this process simply because itøs the only worldview weøve been taught.

However, there is a growing collective-consciousness that with a lot of work and intentionøøøyou can live every moment of your life on your own terms.

You are the designer of your destiny.

You are responsible.

You get to decide. You must decideøøøbecause if you donøt, someone else will.Indecision is a bad decision.

With this short morning routine, your life will quickly change.

It may seem like a long list. But in short, itøs really quite simple:

Wake up
Get in the zone
Get moving
Put the right food in your body
Get ready
Get inspired
Get perspective
Do something to move you forward




3. Hard Physical Activity
Despite endless evidence of the need for exercise, only one-third of American men and women between the ages of 25 to 64 years engage in regular physical activity according to the Center for Disease Controløs National Health Interview Survey.

If you want to be among the healthy, happy, and productive people in the world, get in the habit of regular exercise. Many people go immediately to the gym to get their body moving. I have lately found that doing yard work in the wee hours of the morning generates an intense inflow of inspiration and clarity.

Whatever your preference, get your body moving.

Exercise has been found to decrease your chance of depression, anxiety, and stress. It is also related to higher success in your career.

If you donøt care about your body, every other aspect of your life will suffer. Humans are holistic beings.


7. Review Your Life Vision
Your goals should be written downøøøshort term and long term. Taking just a few minutes to read your life vision puts your day into perspective.

If you read your long term goals every day you will think about them every day. If you think about them every day, and spend your days working toward them, theyøll manifest.

Achieving goals is a science. Thereøs no confusion or ambiguity to it. If you follow a simple pattern, you can accomplish all of your goals, no matter how big they are.

A fundamental aspect of that is writing them down and reviewing them every single day.

8. Do At Least One Thing Towards Long-Term Goals
Willpower is like a muscle that depletes when it is exercised. Similarly, our ability to make high quality decisions becomes fatigued over time. The more decisions you make, the lower quality they becomeøøøthe weaker your willpower.

Consequently, you need to do the hard stuff first thing in the morning. The important stuff.

If you donøt, it simply will not get done. By the end of your day, youøll be exhausted. Youøll be fried. There will be a million reasons to just start tomorrow. And you will start tomorrowøøøwhich is never.

So your mantra becomes: The worst comes first. Do that thing youøve been needing to do. Then do it again tomorrow.

If you take just one step toward you big goals every day, youøll realize those goals werenøt really far away.

Conclusion
After youøve done this, no matter what you have for the rest of your day, youøll have done the important stuff first. Youøll have put yourself in a place to succeed. Youøll have inched toward your dreams.

Because youøll have done all these things, youøll show up better in life. Youøll be better at your job. Youøll be better in your relationships. Youøll be happier. Youøll be more confident. Youøll be more bold and daring. Youøll have more clarity and vision.

Your life will shortly change.

You canøt have mornings like this consistently without waking up to all that is incongruent in your life. Those things you despise will meet their demise.Theyøll disappear and never return.

Youøll quickly find youøre doing the work youøre passionate about.

Your relationships will be passionate, meaningful, deep, and fun!

You will have freedom and abundance.

The world, and the universe, will respond to you in beautiful ways.









Lesson 2: Decide Not to Drift
Have you ever noticed how some people just seem to drift through life, without direction or purpose? Maybe you’ve noticed that about your own life.

I did this for nearly 10 years. It made me miserable. I kept complaining to my wife about what I really wanted to do but was too afraid to do.


Are you just drifting through life?

Too many people just drift through life, going with the flow, never having any direction about where they want their lives to go. They are like a paper cup that blows around in the car park at the shopping Centre. It is totally at the whim of the wind and it just floats around from one side of the car park to the other. Do you know anyone like that?

The same winds of destiny blows over all of us, why is it that some people are able to make a huge success out of their lives, whilst other people never seem to achieve anything at all. If the winds that we face every day, are the same then, the only difference can be the set of the sails. How do you choose to set your sails, are you going to allow the wind to blow you wherever it whims you to go or are you going to take control of your sails from today and start determining where your ship will sail to.




“The two most important requirements for major success are: first, being in the right place at the right time, and second, doing something about it” says Ray Kroc



tomorrow owes you the sum of your yesterday's. no more, no less




The world doesnøt need more small-minded people.

It doesnøt need more people following the norms of society.

Average is over.

To be average in todayøs world is to be addicted to technology, stimulants, unhealthy eating, and distraction.

To be average today is to spend more than half of your work day in a semi-conscious state, in-and-out of focus. You ride caffeine buzzes for shorter and shorter amounts. Day-by-day, you lower your personal standards for what you can do with your time.

You get in life what you tolerate, as Tony Robbins has said.






Kipchoge’s philosophy in life is to live simple, work hard and be honest. In the documentary’s final scene, Kipchoge makes a powerful statement that I’m now carrying with me. “If you don’t rule your mind it can rule you. I tell my mind that I am really able to do this thing and I will do it.”


I heard you deleted the Internet from your phone. And that you deleted Twitter and Instagram and e-mail. No way that's true, right? 
It is! Whenever you check for a new post on Instagram or whenever you go on The New York Times to see if there's a new thing, it's not even about the content. It's just about seeing a new thing. You get addicted to that feeling. You're not going to be able to control yourself. So the only way to fight that is to take yourself out of the equation and remove all these things. What happens is, eventually you forget about it. You don't care anymore. When I first took the browser off my phone, I'm like, [gasp] How am I gonna look stuff up? But most of the shit you look up, it's not stuff you need to know. All those websites you read while you're in a cab, you don't need to look at any of that stuff. It's better to just sit and be in your own head for a minute. I wanted to stop that thing where I get home and look at websites for an hour and a half, checking to see if there's a new thing. And read a book instead. I've been doing it for a couple months, and it's worked. I'm reading, like, three books right now. I'm putting something in my mind. It feels so much better than just reading the Internet and not remembering anything.





øI am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.ø øStephen Covey


Wake up each day with a plan to accomplish something meaningful. Something you will feel good about when you turn out the light that night.



5. You Start Your Day With a Sense of Accomplishment
Imagine getting to the end of the day and realizing you didnøt do a damn thing that made your life better. It sucks. If youøve ever spent an entire day swiping on Tinder, messaging people on Facebook, checking email, and wasting time online, you know how shitty you feel at the end of it. Waking up early allows you to start the day with a sense of accomplishment. When I start a day by reading 50 pages and writing 1000 words, that carries into the rest of my day and creates momentum.



This is where it gets a little scary. The challenge is that we never really choose to live reactively. Instead, it just kind of happens. A little bit, every day. Until, one day, we wake up and realize, ømy life is not my own.ø

Think about it. Did you choose, øI will begin checking my email first thing before I get out of bed, and then respond to what everyone else says is important today?ø Was there a moment where you said to yourself, øI will respond immediately, in real time to every email that hits my inbox, every to-do Iøm tasked with and every status update on Facebook?ø

Not likely, you just started doing it, and the technology that supports this behavior is the perfect intermittent reinforcement machine. In short order, it becomes habit. And, it all went down, bit by momentary bit, by surrendering to seemingly innocuous prompts that end up adding up to autopilot, reactive mindlessness.

Thereøs no blame here, itøs become the social norm to build a life this way. But, just because itøs the norm, doesnøt mean itøs good.

Question is, now that you know, what will you do moving forward? Choose with intention, or continue to surrender to a life of default reactive busyness, bundled with the annihilation of agency and intention?


We need to break the cycle of mindless, reactive living and reclaim a sense of choice, agency and intention. We need to step back into the driverøs seat of our lives. To say, øI get to choose. My days, my years, my life belongs to me. Other peopleøs agendas, stories and will are not the primary driver of where I place my attention, my gifts, my love and energy.ø

If we want to fill our days with activities, experiences and peoples, so be it. But, letøs start making those choices actively and proactively. Mindfully, from a place of filling our lives with connection, vitality and meaning. Not reactively, because weøve never stopped to own the responsibility and the blessing of choice.




Most of us go through our days on autopilot, not really living, but merely existing. We have so much outwardly, but feel so empty and lost on the inside. We allow our minds to keep us up late at night, mulling over things that donøt really matter in the end, such as bills, money, what others think of us, etc.

Why do we do this to ourselves? We count down the hours on the clock until we can go home for the day, rest, and do it all again the next day. We run around all chasing something, and wake up one day wondering why we even chased it. It may not matter to you now what you do with each day of your life, but maybe this advice from a dying 24-year-old will give you a wake up call. Let your life be shaped by decisions you made, not by the ones you didnøt.



Most people are ødrifting,ø which means they havenøt taken command of their mind or their life. Drifting is when you let external circumstances determine where you go in life.




But putting pragmatism aside, there is one thing Iød urge everyone to do. Stop just assuming you have a full lifetime to do whatever it is you dream of doing. I know it sounds ridiculously cliched, and of course you never think it will happen to you, but let me assure you that life really can be taken from you at any time, so live it with that reality in mind.
Oh, and please stop complaining about the small stuff !




I started simplifying my life in 2005, about 12 years ago, and since then Iøve not only learned a lot about it, but have written books on simplicity as well. Itøs been one of the best changes Iøve made in my life.

Simplicity has brought less stress, more peace, better finances, more focus, and most importantly ø space in my life for whatøs most important to me. Day, finances, possessions






Thinking twice about how we spend our money and finding ways to extract the most value from what we buy will ensure that our purchases are deliberate, get put into good use and are worth every dime.

Ultimately, many of us eventually realize that itøs better to be at the bottom of the ladder you want to climb than the top of the one you donøt.  Do you best to take this to heart right now.  Thereøs absolutely no reason to be in such a mad rush that you end up at the top of the wrong ladder ø pursuing someone elseøs agenda instead of your own.

Dedicate time every day to focus inward ø mindfulness rituals, mantras, journaling, prayer, gratitude reflection, etc. ø and bring clarity to your daily circumstances and decisions.  By doing so you will undoubtedly open your mind to important ideas and opportunities you simply canøt comprehend in the midst of mindless hustle.


your limited time and energy, so you can put yourself in a position to build the future you want.

Think about your own life and the lives of those close to you.  Most of us have a tendency to do as much as we possibly can ø cramming every waking minute with events, extravagances, tasks and obligations.  And we just keep running in place.

We think doing more will get us more satisfaction, success, etc.  When oftentimes the exact opposite is true.

In his book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen Covey explains that some things in life are important, and some things are just urgent.  Most people spend the vast majority of their lives working on urgent, unimportant activities.

Very few people have focused their time and energy in a way that exclusively prioritizes truly important and meaningful objectives over everything else that pops up.

Less is indeed more!

Thus, the smartest and most effective way to move forward in life is not doing more, but instead doing less by stopping the behaviors that are holding you back.




Let this be another wake-up call for you.  If you donøt intentionally carve out time every day to make progress, you wonøtø øø without question, your time will get lost in the vacuum of excessive overthinking and distraction.  Before you know it, youøll be tired and withered, wondering where all your time went, and wishing you could have another chance.



If youøre not willing to make it a daily ritual ø and actually work on it a little bit every day ø you donøt really want to improve your life as much as you say you do.  You only like the idea of learning to be fit/writing a book/building a business/selling your art/etc.  You donøt actually want to DO it.

But, if you DO want it as much as you say you do, hereøs how to make it a daily ritual:

Letøs look at a few super common goals we typically have as human beings in the modern age:

Lose weight
Write a book
Stop procrastinating
Fall in love with the right person
Be happier
Learn a new language
Travel the world
Save more money
Read more books
How do you turn those big goals into small daily rituals?  Think about what you could do every day that would get you closer to your desired outcome, even if it were only the tiniest imaginable step forward.  Of course, this is not always easy to figure out, but letøs look at some ideas:

Lose weight ø Start walking every evening before you eat dinner, for 10 minutes at first, then increase to 15 minutes after youøve completed a month, then 20 minutes after another month passes, and so forth.  Once you are walking for 45+ minutes a day, make another change ø drink water instead of soda/sugary juice.
Write a book ø Write for 10 minutes a day for a month straight, then step it up to 15 minutes a day, etc.  Eventually settle into a daily ritual of 1-2 hours of uninterrupted writing a day.
Stop procrastinating ø For most of us, our minds operate at peak performance in the morning hours when weøre well rested.  So obviously it would be foolish to use this time for a trivial task like checking Facebook.  These peak performance hours should be 100% dedicated to working on rituals that bring you closer to your goals.  A possible daily ritual: Set a ømost important taskø each morning, then work on it for 10-30 minutes before opening your web browser/smart phone/etc.
Fall in love with the right person ø You have to put yourself out there.  Go somewhere each day and meet and socialize with like-minded people.  Hereøs a good read on meeting the right people.
Be happier ø do something small each day to make the world better, to help people, and to love yourself.
Learn a new language ø Study your chosen foreign language using Rosetta Stone or listen to Pimsleur audio for 10-30 minutes a day.
Travel the world ø Save money (see the next point).  Or start selling your unnecessary belongings, so you can carry your needed belongings in a backpack.  Learn to live with less.  Then book budget-conscious travel arrangements with the money you made from selling the non-essentials.
Save money ø Begin by cutting out smaller expenses (like $8 Starbucks lattes).  Start cooking and eating at home.  Sell your car and bike/walk/take the train.  Downsize to a smaller (or less expensive) home.  Enjoy simple pleasures and free activities, instead of buying stuff.
Read more books ø Read every morning for 10-15 minutes and every evening again for another 10-15 minutes before you go to bed.
You get the idea.  Not all of these specific rituals will work for you and your unique situation, but you could come up with something similar that works better for you.  In any case, the principle applies: Create a small, actionable ritual and live by it daily.

3.  Allow most things to simply be the way they are.

Some things are worth changing.  Most things arenøt.





What/whom did I make better today?
Thatøs another way of saying, øLeave things better than you found them.ø Ending each day by asking yourself what or whom you made better is a great way to keep yourself grounded and focused on what really matters.


Thereøs a brutal truth about life that some people refuse to acceptøyou have no control over many of the things that happen to you.



That’s just it, though. Timing. Is there anything in life that we fight more? As runners we can have a very love-hate relationship with it. I’m reminded of it every winter when I fumble my way through trying to create a race schedule. There are so many races, projects, and dreams to chase. How does one choose between redemption and once-in-a-lifetime opportunities? Between Transvulcania and Madeira, UTMB and Hardrock, JFK and TNF 50? Perhaps the easy answer is not to choose at all, but to do it all. It sounds easy enough. Then there is that little thing called burnout. Not solely from doing too much, it’s a result of doing too much in too little time. There it is again, that time thing. How ironic.





Live with intention.

This is the moral of the story. Don’t let distractions rule your precious time on this planet. Mindfulness starts with little moments throughout your day, and after a few days of using these techniques, I’ve become more aware, less stressed, and care more about my time away from my phone than with it.

Maybe some of these techniques will make you think I’m crazy, but it’s worth it if at least one of them can make your life a bit more peaceful.





And, frankly, the Stoic response to this was pretty extreme. To make themselves appreciate the things they had, these guys would deliberately contemplate losing everything they loved. Theyød think about death. A lot. Theyød deprive themselves of every pleasure to force themselves to stop taking things for granted.

From The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living:


Hereøs a lesson to test your mindøs mettle: take part of a week in which you have only the most meager and cheap food, dress in shabby clothes, and ask yourself if this is really the worst that you feared. ø Seneca, Moral Letters, 18.5-6


And research shows doing that really works. But it ainøt any kind of fun. Luckily, there is a less painful way to get similar resultsø

Whatøs something you used to relish that you now take for granted? Did that first morning cup of coffee used to be a wonderful moment ø and now itøs just something you hastily gulp down? Well, skip it for three days.

This isnøt merely something old dead guys recommend. When I spoke to Harvard professor Mike Norton he said this is how you can regain appreciation for the things that youøve taken for granted. Make them a treat. Hereøs Mike:


If you love, every day, having the same coffee, donøt have it for a few days and then when you have it again, itøs going to be way more amazing than all of the ones that you would have had in the meantimeø Itøs not øgive it up forever.ø Itøs øgive it up for short periods of time, and I promise you youøre going to love it even more when you come back to it.ø


And then, once the three days are over, oh man, SAVOR that coffee ø or whatever it is that youøve denied yourself. Yes, the Stoics want you to deeply enjoy it. They werenøt a bunch of joyless bores and they werenøt like Spock from øStar Trek.ø They didnøt believe in being unemotional; they just fought negative emotions.

The Stoics believed in living in the present moment so you could enjoy life more.

From The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living:


Itøs ruinous for the soul to be anxious about the future and miserable in advance of misery, engulfed by anxiety that the things it desires might remain its own until the very end. For such a soul will never be at rest ø by longing for things to come it will lose the ability to enjoy present things. ø Seneca, Moral Letters, 98.5b-6a


And, yes, science backs up Stoic savoring. When youøre focused on the present and turn your attention to the pleasurable experience in front of you, youøre happier.



The key component to effective savoring is focused attention. By taking the time and spending the effort to appreciate the positive, people are able to experience more well-being.


Deprive yourself a bit ø then savor the hell out it. This is how you can stop wanting and start enjoying what you have.

(To learn the 4 Stoic secrets to becoming mentally strong, click here.)

Now itøs time for the big one: how can you make sure your life keeps getting better? Or, put another way: how can you make sure youøre getting better at life? Not making the same mistakes, always learning and improving so that every day is better than the one before? Toga-truth to the rescueø


Fear is your compass. Go towards it. 



Here are some other things you could do for an hour per day:

Learn a new language
Call a few friends or family members
Exercise
Cook a meal

If you're thinking, "I want that! Help!" you've come to the right place.




I have discovered my hobbies and interests are very cheap. I like hiking, working out, and tinkering with computers.

Since I don't strongly desire to spend a lot of money, it doesn't make sense to work long enough earn a lot of money.


Today, right now, is the best time ever to choose to do something that truly matters. Something meaningful to you. That ONE thing that makes you create value that means a lot to you. Something you alone can share with the rest of us. Something you are capable of doing but continue to put off because you think you are not ready.

You have everything you need to, at least try. The world needs more creators, not consumers. It has never been easier to decide to be responsible for your own work, for the change you expect.

The most important obvious benefit of pursuing your amazing work is the fulfilment it brings. When you begin to do øactual workø that means the world to you, everything falls in place.


Your purpose in life is to find and do the things that make you smile, laugh and lose yourself. Even if you arenøt sure yet, move into the exploration and experimentation phase of your life and enjoy the journey. You canøt put time on it. You canøt force yourself to find your øwhyø tomorrow or next month, or even next year. But make significant effort in the direction of your dreams one step at a time daily.

In Manøs Search for Meaning, Viktor suggests three ways for finding meaning in our lives:

By creating a work or doing a deed
By experiencing something or encountering someone
By the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering
Pursuing your øwhyø changes everything. You wonøt discover your lifeøs work by wondering or worrying about it. And it doesnøt come fully formed. Youøll discover it by taking action, everyday.

By looking at what is working and what isnøt, you can align yourself with your why and what or the passion and purpose for your life. Clarity is the first step to crafting a life you love.


But if you feel like your nights and weekends continually slip by in a haze of Netflix and web surfing, and aren’t as edifying, entertaining, and/or enriching as you’d like, you can apply the same principles of time management to getting more from your leisure time.

To take control of your hours rather than being controlled by them and feeling lost at the end of the day, track your time. Below I walk you through the benefits and specific tools to use to conduct this experiment and begin getting more out of life.

But the kicker is the immense (and immediate) positive impact Thanhøs friendship has had on both our personal and professional growth.

The undeniable truth became crystal clear to us rather quickly: Who you associate with makes all the difference in your life.

In many ways we, as human beings, are like Koi fish.  The Koi fish grows in proportion to its environment.  If you keep it in a small bucket of water, it grows to only a few of inches in length.  But if you let it loose in the wild it can grow up to two feet long.

So are you like the Koi fish that has been kept in a small bucket?  Is your environment and social network stifling your personal and professional growth?

If so, how do you make changes and build healthier relationships?




#5: Rebel Against the Norm.

Society holds strange expectations around how we should spend our money.

If we spend $15,000 on a Honda Civic, nobody questions the purchase. No one asks, øHow could you afford it?ø or exclaims, øWow, youøre soooo lucky!ø

But if we spend this same $15,000 on a scuba-diving trip through the South Pacific islands, people raise eyebrows. They assume weøre filthy rich, or weøre up to our eyeballs in credit card debt, or weøre sponging off some sexy benefactor.

Nobody seems satisfied with the simple, honest answer: øI hustled hard and I spent waaayyy less than I earned.ø

If we buy a house for ourselves, nobody questions the purchase. No one says, øWow, you bought a two-bedroom fixer-upper starter home?! You must be loaded!ø

But if we buy an investment property, people raise eyebrows. øAre you some fancy-pants investor? Where did you get that kind of money?ø

Weøre spending the same amount of money as our next door neighbor, but weøre buying different things. They bought a boat; we bought investments.

Society says thatøs weird. Theyøll raise eyebrows, ask questions and make assumptions. Be okay with that. Youøre part of a rebellion.

Itøs a rebellion against mediocrity. A rebellion against following the herd and getting the same results. If you spend the way that everyone else does, youøll carry the same debts that they do. Youøll work until youøre 68, then look back and wonder: øIs this all there is?ø


You deserve better.




 You must wage a rebellion from social norms. Stop caving to social pressures and keeping-up-appearances. Extraordinary results come from extraordinary (not-ordinary) choices.

Add some chaos to your life. A certain amount is healthy. It stimulates growth and change and passion and excitement.



Wake up each day with a plan to accomplish something gggeaningful. Something you will feel good about when you turn out the light that night.

This is where it gets a little scary. The challenge is that we never really choose to live reactively. Instead, it just kind of happens. A little bit, every day. Until, one day, we wake up and realize, ømy life is not my own.ø

Think about it. Did you choose, øI will begin checking my email first thing before I get out of bed, and then respond to what everyone else says is important today?ø Was there a moment where you said to yourself, øI will respond immediately, in real time to every email that hits my inbox, every to-do Iøm tasked with and every status update on Facebook?ø

Not likely, you just started doing it, and the technology that supports this behavior is the perfect intermittent reinforcement machine. In short order, it becomes habit. And, it all went down, bit by momentary bit, by surrendering to seemingly innocuous prompts that end up adding up to autopilot, reactive mindlessness.


Whatøs the alternative to the reactive, autopilot life of busyness that you recommend for a good life?

Jonathan: Awareness and intention. We need to break the cycle of mindless, reactive living and reclaim a sense of choice, agency and intention. We need to step back into the driverøs seat of our lives. To say, øI get to choose. My days, my years, my life belongs to me. Other peopleøs agendas, stories and will are not the primary driver of where I place my attention, my gifts, my love and energy.ø

If we want to fill our days with activities, experiences and peoples, so be it. But, letøs start making those choices actively and proactively. Mindfully, from a place of filling our lives with connection, vitality and meaning. Not reactively, because weøve never stopped to own the responsibility and the blessing of choice.

Thereøs no blame here, itøs become the social norm to build a life this way. But, just because itøs the norm, doesnøt mean itøs good.

Question is, now that you know, what will you do moving forward? Choose with intention, or continue to surrender to a life of default reactive busyness, bundled with the annihilation of agency and intention?


1. Create a vision for yourself. What is your vision for your own life? Your career is a big part of your life. Get a journal and write in it, or tell your closest friend about your vision. Answer these questions: What do I want to experience in my lifetime, and what do I want to accomplish here on this planet?

2. Develop a plan. What are you working for, apart from just to stay alive? Once you have a vision for your life, you can start to plan it out ø what do you want to accomplish or experience first, second and third?

3. Set goals. Your employer is more than happy to set goals for you inside their environment. Outside your workplace, what are your goals for yourself? Your goals come first ø ahead of your employerøs goals. Itøs your career! Your employer is only one client. What are your goals?

Our lives are mostly the same day in and day out.

Monday-Friday: Wake up, go to work, go to sleep.
Weekend: Get caught up on stuff, have a little fun and drink a couple beers.
Sometimes we go on a vacation to break up the pattern. Once in a great while, something happens and our lives change course. I call them inflection points:

Inflection point: A time of significant change in a situation; a turning point.


Take five-minutes every day to picture what you want in life, and ask yourself if you did something that day that moved you closer to your goal. If not, picture what small steps you can do to catalyze that change.


"Something that worked for me was imagining that where I wanted to be ... was a mountain. A distant mountain. My goal. And I knew that as long as I kept walking towards the mountain I would be all right."



ìMonotony collapses time; novelty unfolds it,î writes Joshua Foer in Moonwalking With Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything. ìYou can exercise daily and eat healthily and live a long life, while experiencing a short one.î When youíre backpacking around a foreign land, the hours stretch out; when youíre rising and grinding through the workweek, a week goes by in a day. Itís also why childhood went so slowly, and adulthood goes by fast.

Back in 1890, the beloved American psychologist William James wrote that ìthe foreshortening of the years as we grow older is due to the monotony of memoryís content.î When youíre a kid, youíre experiencing new things every hour of every day. But with the routine brought along by adulthood, the days and weeks smooth out into ìcontentless units,î he writes. ìIn youth we may have an absolutely new experience, subjective or objective, every hour of the day,î he writes. ìApprehension is vivid, retentiveness strong, and our recollections of that time, like those of a time spent in rapid and interesting travel, are of something intricate, multitudinous and long-drawn-out.î Thatís the magic of travel: being in bewildering, enchanting places awakes that childhood wonder. Immersed in novelty, you pay attention to more, and the days get longer. Life expands.




Why your "relaxing" doesn't work

I'm as much a fan of lazing by the pool as the next woman, but according to legendary psychologist and Flow


author Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, this sort of slothful "relaxation" actually doesn't do much to reset and refresh your brain.
"For quite a few people free time is... wasted," Dahl quotes Csikszentmihalyi as writing. "Leisure provides a relaxing respite from work, but it generally consists of passively absorbing information, without using any skills or exploring new opportunities for action. As a result life passes in a sequence of boring and anxious experiences over which a person has little control."

What should you do instead of binging on your favorite Netflix show or chilling out in your friend's back garden? Csikszentmihalyi insists that if you really want to refresh your mind, you need to engage it. People are "happiest when they were just talking to one another, when they gardened, knitted, or were involved in a hobby," he explains, citing his research and noting that all of these activities "demand a relatively high investment of psychic energy."


e limits of chilling out

It's not justCsikszentmihalyi who makes this point. Time use expert Laura Vanderkam also agrees that the most refreshing breaks aren't necessarily the chillest.

"Other kinds of work--be it exercise, a creative hobby, hands-on parenting, or volunteering--will do more to preserve your zest for Monday's challenges than complete vegetation," she has written before recommending that, if you really want to feel jazzed up after a break, you should proactively schedule challenging or engaging activities rather than just planning to chill and take things the days as they come.

So if you want your break to feel actually enjoyable and worthwhile (and also longer -- laziness makes time feel like it passed in the blink of an eye), you need to actually do something a little challenging.


In your book you talk about an “end” goal vs. a “means” goal? What is that, exactly?

Lakhiani: The difference between a means goal and an end goal is a lesson people should learn early in life. End goals are the beautiful, exciting rewards of being human on planet earth. They speak to your soul and bring joy in and of themselves. “Means” goals are the things society tells us we need to have in place to get happiness – things like hitting a certain income level, getting a specific promotion, etc.

Most people make the mistake of setting what are called means goals, instead of end goals.

A means goal is something you do in order to get to the experience you want to have. It is usually a goal followed by a “so.” For example, I want to get a 9-5 job, so I can save up, so I can someday travel the world. When instead, if you focused simply on traveling, you could find many other opportunities that will help you get the experience of traveling right away.

A means goal is never as fulfilling and does not serve your happiness.

Caprino: What are some characteristic of a “means” goal? How can we tell them from the goals we should be pursuing?

Lakhiani: Here are some key characteristics of “means” goals.

Means goals don’t stand up alone.

Means goals are stepping-stones to something else. They’re part of a sequence. For example: Get a good GPA so you can get into a good college. This often means that goals get strung together into (life) long sequences, like this one: Get a good GPA so you can get into a good college, so you can get a good job, so you can make lots of money, so you can afford a nice house, car, etc., so you’ll have money saved to do all the stuff you really want to do after you retire.

Ask yourself, “Does my goal have a “so” attached to it?”

Ask yourself: “Is my goal something I think I “should” meet as part of achieving my ultimate goal—for example, thinking that I should get a college degree in order to have a fulfilling job or that I should get married in order to have love in my life?”

Many means goals are cleverly concealed Brules. You do not have to get married. Or get a college degree. Or be an entrepreneur. Or join the family business. What you really want is to be in beautiful loving relationships, to have consistent opportunities to learn and grow, and to have freedom, and be financially stable. These can come in many different forms. See the difference?





The quality of your life in the long run directly depends upon how you set and respect your priorities today.


 donøt have time,ø is really just another, perhaps politer, or perhaps naive, way of saying, øIt is not that important to me.ø

Donøt waste your time and energy fighting against where you are.  Invest your time and energy into getting to where you want to go.  And even if you have a good reason to be upset and resentful, let it go.  Channel your energy into thoughts and actions that actually benefit your life right now. 


Do you want to look back on the past 10 years and remember nothing more than the same routine you do every day?


Helpful: Being Open and Not Taking Any Of This So Seriously





Look, at the end, wherever you are at this moment, you are completely, perfectly fine. If we can just remain open to life, enjoy it as much as we can, regardless of our relationship status, life is good.

Stop taking any of this too seriously, our time is so finite & limited, if we waste it too much on worryingÖ blip.. then youíre gone. My 30s have been the best times in my life so far. I may still not know that much, but at least I know that I donít know that much anyway about this whole existence or the meaning of it all.

So, take it easy, my friends, single or not.. Relax, smile, and have some fun!


When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is. And ‘your life’ is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money.
That’s a very limited life.



They say that retirement ruins people who don‚Äôt know how to keep busy. After spending most of our adult lives working, to suddenly stop doing what we‚Äôre so familiar doing feels odd.

7. "Isn't it funny how day by day nothing changes but when you look back, everything is different?" -C.S. Lewis


Am I making the right use of my scarce and precious life?‚Äù

If you could do tomorrow over again, would you? Most of us live programmed lives. Tomorrow is set, finished, done, and you haven‚Äôt even started it yet. And we accept that as part of the deal in setting goals and reaching them. But what about the tomorrow thirty days from now? Or a year? If you could do those over, would you?


For everyone I talk to, I try to learn one thing.
Then I try to teach it within the next day.
Then I try to use it within the next day.
If you learn one life-changing thing a day, then you will learn 365 life-changing things a year. And the effect on your life will compound.

From Jesse Itzler I learned, ‚ÄúNo matter where you feel maximum pain, you can always do 40% more.‚Äù

So then I wrote about it.

And then I did 40% more push-ups after I thought I was going to collapse.



As the old saying goes, a goal without a plan is just a wish. When you care about your goals, you commit to seeing them through. People who care have clear written goals accomplish far more in a shorter period of time than those people who wing it.


You wonder ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWhere do my days go?‚Äù

You are busier than ever before, but you have very little to show for all that time spent working and hustling.

Gurus tell you that time is your most precious resource, but it seems to fly by like never before. You‚Äôre overwhelmingly busy, but your to-do list stays a mile long.  Technology promises to streamline your life, but in reality, all it seems to do is complicate it.

You spend your days rushing and being pulled in five different directions at any given moment.  Priorities change constantly.  Your inbox can‚Äôt go 20 minutes without a massive download of emails.  Your job responsibilities are intense, and, simultaneously, your co-workers keep sending you meeting invites.  Then you rush home to try and prepare a healthy dinner that your family will actually like, all the while texting your best friend and catching up with social media updates.



2. Be decisive
Any time I have to make a decision, I ask myself this question: Does this bring me closer of further away from my goals?

Answering this single question makes me a lot more focused on doing what is important. It brings my life in perspective instantly. It allows me to un-clutter my life.

It is a simple principle, but its impact is real.

Small consistent steps in the same direction create momentum. And momentum will cause big changes over time. It will bring you inexorably to reaching your goals.

This assumes you have set goals already. If you haven‚Äôt, what are you waiting for?


4. Start with why
Most people have goals. But sadly, very often they don‚Äôt have reasons for achieving their goals. Or at least not strong ones.

This usually results in people giving up before the finish line.

The antidote to not achieving your goals is to have reasons. That means starting with why.

To illustrate, let‚Äôs say your goal is to lose weight. To find your reason for losing weight, the question to ask yourself would be: Why do you want to lose weight? And the answer might be: To be more fit.

Then you have to dig further until you have found the fundamental reason for losing weight.

That means asking: Why do you want to be more fit? It could be to increase your chances to find a partner. Or because it is endangering your health.

Asking ‚Äúwhy‚Äù questions systematically will lead you to your reason. In the example above, the fundamental reason you might end up with could be: to live longer, or to be happier in a healthy relationship.

Having strong reasons gives me tons of motivation to pursue my goals and makes each goal more meaningful. It also filters out ‚Äúweak‚Äù goals, that I will just drop. It‚Äôs another way to un-clutter.



8 Mind Hacks That Give You Instant Results 

SAVE MONEY WITH A PURPOSE

If you‚Äôre saving money just for money‚Äôs sake, then eventually you will hit a wall and ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of working so hard and saving so much?‚Äù I hit that wall at 25, after only 2.5 years of killing myself at work. I received a financial windfall after one lucky stock pick, and saved 100% of my annual bonus plus another 30%-50% of my base salary.

I was so burnt out that I was *THIS CLOSE* to short-circuiting my career by moving back home to Hawaii to plant mangoes for a living. The 5:30am work start and 9pm departures were really beginning to warp my mind. I was even considering working at a Merrill Lynch brokerage branch in Honolulu for $40,000 a year, rather than keep my six figure job, just so I could see more sunshine (it was dark when I got to work, and dark when I left work for the majority of months).

Just because you're not in your 20s anymore doesn't mean you need to give up enjoying life. Bach says he spent the early half of his adult life chasing money, and it only made him unhappy and more cynical about life.

Go on dates with your significant other. Take your kids on trips. Go to concerts with your best friends. Just don't forget that the money you work to make is useless if you're miserable.

If you don‚Äôt purposefully carve time out every day to progress and improve‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwithout question, your time will get lost in the vacuum of our increasingly crowded lives. Before you know it, you‚Äôll be old and withered‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwondering where all that time went.

As Professor Harold Hill has said‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚ÄúYou pile up enough tomorrows, and you‚Äôll find you are left with nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays.‚Äù

Rethinking Your Life and Getting Out of Survival Mode

This article is intended to challenge you to rethink your entire approach to life. The purpose is to help you simplify and get back to the fundamentals.

Sadly, most people‚Äôs lives are filled to the brim with the nonessential and trivial. They don‚Äôt have time to build toward anything meaningful.


Life can be a lot of the same old, same old. We get stuck in routines, and our lives almost become one giant checklist. As we live each year without making the changes or living the kind of life we want to live, we end up existing in life.

Truly living doesn‚Äôt mean traveling the world and jumping off of cliffs in some cool country‚Äîunless that‚Äôs your dream. It means that you don‚Äôt settle for a good enough life when you could be living your dream. Make it a habit to truly live each day as if it were your last because it might be.


‚ÄúAre you truly living, or just breathing?‚Äù ‚Äì Jensen Siaw


I didn‚Äôt get any lucky breaks. I didn‚Äôt win the lottery or get a big inheritance. I worked hard on creating these habits in my life and took focused action for three years. Today I wake living my dream life and what a successful life means to me. I wake up each day determined to keep building on the progress I‚Äôve made.

You can do this. You can create healthy habits that lead to an incredible life. You can wake up each day happy, knowing you‚Äôre living the kind of life you‚Äôve always dreamed of living. It will be hard. It will take time‚Äîmaybe a lot of time. But, it will be worth it to spend each day living life on your terms. You‚Äôve got this!



The findings show the more time that‚Äôs passed after a marathon, the less pain runners remember feeling.

‚ÄúThe major finding of this study is that pain induced by running a marathon is not remembered accurately,‚Äù the study says.

‚ÄúTypically we think pain is just physiological, but people need to understand that pain is also an emotional experience,‚Äù Eddie O‚ÄôConnor, the head sports psychologist at the Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan told Runner‚Äôs World Newswire. ‚ÄúFor marathon runners, as the time goes on you recreate the memory to remember more of the positive aspects of the race.‚Äù

That means you may forget the popping blister at mile 23, but you won‚Äôt forget the swinging medal around your neck as you sip a beer.



Putting aside time isnít an easy thing to do anymore. We all have so much shit going on that it feels damn near impossible to squeeze a little more time out of our days.

But I promise you, itís possible. If you were pretty ruthless, youíd be able to find things youíre doing every day that are wasting the time you could use to do something incredible.

I realised a few weeks ago that my morning routine was spending 30ñ45 minutes on my iPhone before getting in the shower. Just reading random crap online.

I turned that into my book time. Now I spend roughly half an hour every morning working on my books before I start the day.

Most people would say, ìwhy would you work more?î And then they turn on Netflix and watch back to back episodes of Daredevil.

A different mindset.

Being useful is a mindset. And like with any mindset, it starts with a decision. One day I woke up and thought to myself: What am I doing for this world? The answer was nothing.

And that same day I started writing. For you it can be painting, creating a product, helping elderly, or anything you feel like doing.

Donít take it too seriously. Donít overthink it. Just DO something thatís useful. Anything.

You see? Itís not anything big. But when you do little useful things every day, it adds up to a life that is well lived. A life that mattered.

The last thing I want is to be on my deathbed and realize thereís zero evidence that I ever existed.

It comes down to this: What are you DOING thatís making a difference?

Did you do useful things in your lifetime? You donít have to change the world or anything. Just make it a little bit better than before you were born.

If you donít know how, here are some ideas.

Help your boss with something thatís not your responsibility.
Take your mother to a spa.
Create a collage with pictures (not a digital one) for your spouse.
Write an article about the stuff you learned in life.
Help the pregnant lady who also has a 2-year old with her stroller.
Call your friend and ask if you can help with something.
Build a standing desk.
Start a business and hire an employee and treat them well.

Most things we do in life are just activities and experiences.

You go on holiday.
You go to work.
You go shopping.
You have drinks.
You have dinner.
You buy a car.
Those things should make you happy, right? But they are not useful. Youíre not creating anything. Youíre just consuming or doing something. And thatís great.

Donít get me wrong. I love to go on holiday, or go shopping sometimes. But to be honest, itís not what gives meaning to life.

What really makes me happy is when Iím useful. When I create something that others can use. Or even when I create something I can use.
