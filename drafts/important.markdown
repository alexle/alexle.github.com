How much of what you read today will you still care about a year from now?

80%?

Half?

Any of it?

I ask myself this question a lot, and it’s painful. If I’m honest with myself the answer is often close to none. We noticed some years ago that much of the information we consumed was expiring knowledge. Examples of expiring knowledge might include: which cable company got acquired last week? How did manager X perform last year? What is the office vacancy rate in New York City?

While the answers to these questions represent useful context that could help us make decisions today, none have long-term value. In contrast, long-term knowledge might be represented by answers to questions such as: why is the cable industry consolidating? What is the competitive advantage of manager X and is it sustainable? What are the long-term drivers of demand for office space in various cities in the U.S.?




The older you get, the more youøll worry about never being able to get out of the rat race. You start asking yourself, øis this all there is to life?ø Youøll also start resenting your job and the people you see more than your family every single day. Itøs natural after doing the same old thing over and over again. As a result, youøll start kicking your savings and investing into high gear so that you might one day be able to engineer your layoff and live life on your own terms. Those who are more aware are able to quantify their purchases, not only in after tax dollars, but in terms of time. For example, buying a $300,000 more expensive house because it has one more bedroom youøll never use equals at least 10 more years of work if you only save $30,000 a year. No rational person would choose driving a Porsche and buying a mega mansion if the cost was a 20 year delay in achieving financial freedom. Stretching your finances every month is a stressful way to live.




Perhaps the most important and recent addition to my routine is that I write in the Five Minute Journal while I have my breakfast. In particular, the question of øWhat would make today great?ø has empowered me to think about not only goals I want to accomplish but also little things, like øCall mom to tell her I love herø or øEnjoy Netflix today without feeling guilty.ø I find that Iøm often so obsessed with ødoingø that I donøt stop to think about how doing certain things make me feel or why I do them in the first place. øWhat would make today great?ø changed the game for me



So stop kidding yourself into believing that extra 15 minutes of coding will get your new startup somewhere and go spend time with your kid, your wife, or someone who really matters in your life. And never forget how the smallest things can have the greatest impact on someones daily life.



If you want something different: improve you.

Most people focus on their craft or their øjob.ø Thatøs all well and good. However, youøll get far more bang-for-your-buck by focusing on yourself.

20% of your energy should be devoted to your work.

80% of your energy should be devoted to rest and self-improvement. This is what fuels your work and makes it better than anyone elseøs. Self-improvement is more than books and true rest is renewal.

While others are trying to improve their job, youøre continuously improving yourself, expanding your vision, skills, and abilities. This is akin to Stephen R. Coveyøs 7th principle: Sharpen your saw. Most people are trying to chop down their treeøøøtheir øjobøøøøwith a dull saw.

øGive me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.øøøøAbraham Lincoln

Within a short period of time, youøll have developed true mastery. Everyone else is trying to hone their øcraft.ø Donøt work on your job. Work on yourself.

When you do, your work will far exceed what other people are painstakingly producing. Your work will be cleaner, clearer, and more powerful because youøll be more evolved as a person. Most people youøre øcompetingø against are an inner mess.





I’m probably too young to be writing on this topic but observing countless souls distressed by daily life made me think hard on what is that really matters in life. Undoubtedly, there are happy and sad phases and that’s part-and-parcel of life. But what I’m really bothered about is general, daily bitching about how miserable one’s life has become. You find people complaining about work, commute, relationships, other people’s attitudes & personalities, neighbor’s barking dog, lack of parking space, and, heck, some people also feel stressed about how they are unable to install latest iPhone update. Yes, I’m concerned about those people. Are these things really worth stressing about? Allow me to analyze.

What doesn’t matter in life

Let’s start off by observing what doesn’t matter in life and why. Life would be much better and satisfying if everyone could do away with (or at least de-prioritizes following) two aspects:

Material possessions: countless sages have professed it and I completely with them that material possessions are source of most of the stress we face in our daily lives. Modern technology (and compulsion to keep up with it) only makes it much worse. Your car radiator broke down, your phone screen got a crack, you are unable to install USB drivers, or your expensive massage chair needs maintenance. Possessions end up taking over your daily life and you don’t even realize that. Wouldn’t you be much happier and free if you need not bother about constant purchasing, maintaining and discarding of possessions? I’m not advocating complete asceticism but my point here is that it is OK to be still using Windows 98. It is OK to travel by bus or taxi, and not having that fancy car. It is even OK if you don’t posses a phone (. It is OK to be like a free bird without any heavy baggage of material possessions.

Experiences: seeking out new experiences in life is one of the best ways to be alive. Experiences excite, teach and rejuvenate you. Unlike material possessions, the memories, stories and photographs of these experiences will never fade away and certainly don’t require an upkeep. Have you ever thought of travelling the world? If not, do it! (Budget’s not a constraint). Learn a new language. Go bungee jumping. Do hitch-hiking. Start a new charity organization. Try new, exotic cuisines. There are literally millions of different types of experiences that you can seep in and most don’t take bagful of money. Usually, under false pretense of being busy in daily humdrum, it is your ego that prevents you from exposing yourself to different types of experiences, and hence doesn’t let you mature you as a person and live life to its fullest. The best part about these experiences is that you get to meet many interesting people, some of whom can also become lifelong friends and partners. This brings us to next point.
Relationships: treasuring and maintaing relationships you have with your parents, friends, siblings, spouses, children and even neighbours is one of the most satisfying aspects of life. 

I can tell you about the Brazilian Amazon, if you would like. I can tell you about the Nile. I can describe the Northern lights as they are seen from the Icelandic shores and I can let you touch the sands of Jordan that I keep in a box on my dresser. But the most important truths of life, the most incredible stories I have, are of the people Iíve loved. The connections Iíve made. The friends who have been on skype at four in the morning their time because it was midnight for me and I was lonely. Itís love that changes us, not pins on a map or footsteps on the globe. It is the ways we create and adapt and begin that shapes the people we become, whether we do those things in a tiny village in Vietnam or from our boring old hometown in Connecticut.

If you want to travel, travel. But donít feel as though you have to do so. Donít feel as though youíre missing out, watching life pass, becoming a slight and less dignified person by finding opportunities within a 25 mile radius. You will become who youíll become because there is a specific genetic makeup that makes you you. The same oxygen reaches your brain and the same blood gets pumped to your heart anywhere you are on this earth. 



Where You Might Stop Yourself from Splurging

Many of us already use our disposable income to comfort ourselves, but we might not be doing this in the most optimal manner. Instead of dumping money into, say, a jet-ski you only use four weekends a year, investing in things you use every single day can make you happier in the long run, even if they're not as flashy a purchase. It's easy to get into the habit of retail therapy for items we use very infrequently to make ourselves feel better, but it's not often that we consider how much these purchases will improve our day-to-day existences. (And if you really must have a jet-ski, think about renting instead of buying.)

We also need to keep the concept of "good enough" in mind, because you'll eventually reach the point of diminishing returns. There might be a big difference between a $500 computer and a $1000 computer, but you'll notice much less of one between a $1500 and $2000 computer. And if you already have a car that's been made in the last 5 years, there probably won't be much you need to upgrade to, seeing as you can do incremental updates on your stereo system or GPS navigation.

Of course, if money's tight, the comfort principle can't always apply. If you're finding yourself trying to save money by curbing excess spending, you might not have the freedom to pick up luxury items like a nice chair or a better smartphoneøbut the principle might help you redefine what is and isn't considered luxury.

By evaluating and making a list of what it is you do all day and then applying the comfort principle, you can make sure your dollars are going to the areas in your life that have the highest impact on your happiness.



When something bad happens, ask yourself, øWhat would I recommend if this happened to someone else?ø And then do that. Youøll probably be more rational. And itøs harder to ignore the advice ø because itøs your own.

From A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy:

In his Handbook, Epictetus advocates this sort of øprojective visualization.ø Suppose, he says, that our servant breaks a cup. We are likely to get angry and have our tranquility disrupted by the incident. One way to avert this anger is to think about how we would feel if the incident had happened to someone else instead. If we were at someoneøs house and his servant broke a cup, we would be unlikely to get angry; indeed, we might try to calm our host by saying øItøs just a cup; these things happen.ø Engaging in projective visualization, Epictetus believes, will make us appreciate the relative insignificance of the bad things that happen to us and will therefore prevent them from disrupting our tranquility.
