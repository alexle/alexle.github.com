2. Youâ€™re Undervalued
Doing a great job when no one is there to appreciate it (or even recognize it) is terribly defeating. We all want to be patted on the back every now and then. And working somewhere where you arenâ€™t getting proper recognition is kind of like being in a relationship without affection or attentionâ€”youâ€™ll likely start to wonder if youâ€™re valued or even liked. Not only is a place like that de-motivatingâ€”but if your boss refuses to acknowledge and commend your accomplishments, that can also be a sign that youâ€™re not going to promoted or given adequate opportunities to advance. If you truly arenâ€™t appreciated at your current workplaceâ€”it may be time to go somewhere else where your contribution is valued.

5. Youâ€™re Not Learning and Growing
Just like not having the tools or resources to do your work can cause problems, so can having your growth stunted, stalled, or slowed down. If youâ€™re not challenged or given opportunities to learn and grow in your job, it may be time to seek employment in an organization that actually will support your personal and career growth.


6. Itâ€™s Not the Right Fit
Things change: bosses change, markets change, jobs change, and your life situation changes. What may have been the perfect job before, may not be working anymore. And thatâ€™s okay.

If you feel your job or career isnâ€™t aligning with your hopes, dreams, goals, and objectives for your life, itâ€™s time for a serious work-life evaluation (which could result in a job change).

When you first began working for your company maybe you, like I, had stars in your eyes with dreams of advancement to the top ranks. In no time you would be the one calling the shots, making the decisions, running the show.  Your work ethic was unmatched and you made every effort to go above and beyond at every opportunity in order to stand out above the crowd.  You took on special assignments, working late & on weekends.  You did your best to rub elbows with the big dogs without coming off as an ass-kisser.



As time kept marching on you began to realize that despite everything you have ever been told about career advancement, you are making absolutely no progress.  Maybe you got a small promotion & an insignificant pay raise, but it hasnâ€™t been the ride to the top you thought it was going to be.  You find yourself not caring so much about your performance.  It seems pointless to work so hard when everyone else is performing at a level much less than you yet receiving the same treatment.  No longer are you willing to sacrifice your free time for this company.  No more overtime, no more special projects.  Soon you slip into the shadows & become just another employee; a number on the payroll roster.


“Thank you.” “You’re doing great work.” “Way to go!” Such simple words of encouragement cost nothing, but go a long way towards motivating employees.

I firmly believe managers don’t do enough to express gratitude towards their employees. If they did, there would be much less turnover, much higher worker satisfaction, and ultimately higher profits for the firm.

Sometimes business is just bad and there’s no room for a pay raise or promotion. No problem. Take your employees out to lunch to show them your gratitude for coming in early or going above and beyond for a client. A lack of recognition by their managers is consistently one of the top complaints I hear from people who want to engineer their layoff. Some want to take it a step further and “stick it to their employers” for all the years of mistreatment.

Firms need to do more in the ways of managerial training. Often times, the best producer gets promoted to become manager instead of the best person with managerial abilities. This trend causes all sorts of problems down the road. Training classes need to focus on teaching managers how to motivate employees by understanding their sincerest desires. My research shows that recognition is at the top of the list. Let’s look at more reasons why employees are so disengaged.



 Even better than giving ample notice is being communicative about what's making you unhappy in your job. I find that employees very often overestimate their importance to the company (we're all replaceable) but severely underestimate their ability to request change within the organization -- whether it's a change in job roles, or ways to make the job more enjoyable, etc. So communicate those things early. Don't wait until you're so fed up that you're looking around. Empower yourself mentally to create an environment you love and you can thrive in.

As a manager, the effects I observed on employees during these varying career climates were unmistakable.   At times when career paths were clear, individuals tended to be more motivated, with tangible goals to work toward.   At times when career paths were dim or nonexistent, individuals tended to be less motivated, less focused, more uncertain.  Though there are of course many types of employee rewards, monetary and non-monetary, the reward of career advancement is an especially powerful one.

It¿s only natural.  Talented people want to advance.  They want to get ahead.  As a great advertising slogan (could no longer find the origin ¿ if you recall it, it please let me know!) once succinctly put it, ¿Amercians want to succeed, not merely survive.¿

That¿s why it makes good business sense for organizations of all sizes to spend time developing and maintaining thoughtfully structured career path systems ¿ an extremely valuable HR function.  And it doesn¿t have to be a painfully expensive proposition.  Even if at times the dollar value associated  with an individual promotion may be slight, the perceived value for that employee within a given culture may be substantial.
 

Reason #1: “I don’t feel valued.”

Mother Teresa once said that there is more hunger in this world for appreciation than there is for bread. Certainly over the years the most unhappy workers I’ve met are those who feel their hard work, time and talents are simply taken for granted. It’s why one of the first things I direct leaders to focus on is ensuring that those in their team feel fully valued by them. It takes so little time to acknowledge people for what they do, and the attitude they bring to work every day, yet it can make such a profound difference. If you don’t feel valued in your workplace, you mighty want to share how you feel with your supervisor. If you feel that won’t make a difference (or you’ve tried it and it didn’t), then you might be best served by looking to find a place to work where you will be valued.

The findings from a recent study by The Energy Project found employees that feel valued and appreciate are 13 more times likely to stay in an organization and are 67% more engaged. Needless to say, if you’re in a leadership role, the single most important thing you can do every day is to make sure people know that they are their efforts are valued.
