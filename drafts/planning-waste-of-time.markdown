Planning

Planning is a total waste of time.  It provides no benefit to the bottom line.  The supposed benefit of planning is to be able to identify how much work a team can do in a sprint and use those metrics to plan releases and schedules.

The concept seems solid.  It seems to make sense, but the problem is we are devoting one day of a two week sprint to an activity that basically gathers metrics.  That is a 10% overhead if your planning session doesn’t go over a single day.  Essentially, planning’s primary purpose is to chart velocity and commit to some amount of work.  



What killed us was ¿one more thing.¿ We could have easily done three major releases that year if we had drawn a line in the sand, said ¿finished,¿ and shipped the darn thing. The problem is that the longer it¿s been since your last release the more pressure and anticipation there is, so you¿re more likely to try to slip in just one more thing or a fix that will make a feature really shine. For some projects, this literally goes on forever.


[...]I imagine prior to the launch of the iPod, or the iPhone, there were teams saying the same thing: the copy + paste guys are *so close* to being ready and we know Walt Mossberg is going to ding us for this so let¿s just not ship to the manufacturers in China for just a few more weeks¿ The Apple teams were probably embarrassed. But if you¿re not embarrassed when you ship your first version you waited too long.


Shipping early and often, he continues, gives you the critical feedback from users that¿s needed to improve your work:



Why Action Trumps Everything (Especially Planning), If You Want To Achieve Anything Worthwhile
There is the wonderful quote that you have probably heard. It goes like this:
“No plan ever survives contact with the enemy.”

It is from Prussian Field Marshal Helmth von Molke (who actually said “no plan of operations extends with any certainity beyond the first contact with the main body of the enemy,” but the short-hand version is close enough.)

No matter how you present it, the quote is right. You can plan all you want in a vacuum but until you get on the battlefield (of business in our case) you never know exactly what is going to happen. And the first time the enemy (your competition) does something you don’t expect–and that is probably going to be on day 1–all your planning is out the window.

That is one reason I am not a huge fan of planning. Once you are underway, things never go exactly the way you anticipate.

But the problems with elaborate planning actually start before that.

As we talked about before, the longer you plan, the longer you are not in the marketplace. And that means three things are happening in the interim, and none of them are good.

1. No revenues are coming in.

2. Someone could beat you to the punch and introduce your great idea before you do.

3. The market is changing and as a result you could fall out of step.

Given all those reasons, puting together a full blown business plan doesn’t make any sense to me, unless you need tens of millions to get underway. In that case, you are going to need to do one. Professional investors, such as venture capitalists, are going to require it.

But few of us need that kind of money. If you don’t, do the absolute minimum amount of research, just enough to convince yourself the idea is a good one, and then get out into the marketplace and ask people to give you an order. If the answer is yes, you have done all the research you need.

One last thing about this. You might wonder why if everyone has heard “No plan ever survives contact with the enemy,” why so many people still spend so much time planning.

Well, I believe that great business philosopher Mike Tyson (yes, of boxing fame) figured it out.

While being interviewed one day, Tyson was told his opponent for an upcoming fight said he had a plan for knocking out the champ.

Tyson, channeling his inner von Molke, responded: ”Everyone has a plan, ’til they get punched in the mouth.”

I think the people who do excess planning are trying to avoid getting punched in the mouth by putting off getting into the marketplace as long as possible. That’s just silly. The market is going to react whether you enter today, tomorrow or in six months. Far better to get out there today so that you can counter-punch.



Again, seems like a solid concept, but here are some of the problems.  First of all, estimation is almost always wrong.  The only way to get a real accurate estimation is to talk about the backlog item until you have squeezed all the requirements out of it up front.  And if you do that, then your planning will probably take two days.


Commitment

One central unspoken theme of Scrum is commitment.  The team commits to get a certain amount of work done in a sprint.  The business commits to not change the work the team is working on.  These commitments are critical, because without them time boxing fails, velocity metrics fail, and trust is lost in both directions.

So, what is wrong with commitments?  They cannot be followed.  Everyone means well, at least I hope they do.  The problem is, like a fat kid in a candy store, they just can’t help themselves.  The business doesn’t want to change priorities, but a critical issue comes up.  The development team wants to commit to the sprint, but the development team can’t make more code get done faster simply by wanting to.  They can add more hours to the sprint, but then they are skewing the velocity.  The only way the development team can realistically commit to the sprint is to ‘pad’, and that is a very bad word.  Don’t ever say ‘pad’ in a development shop.



Ship Often and Early

In the end, satisficing is all about execution. It emphasizes making smart decisions that allow you to create faster. So, as you execute, it’s important that you ship the results out into the world, rather than sit on them until you’re sure they’re perfect. Think of it as a beta test through which you gather valuable real-world feedbackbefore moving on. For example, say you were asked to develop a new reporting format for your sales department. The satisficing approach would be to develop the format, then send it to your team for review and feedback before you spend weeks building a complex algorithm that no one ends up needing anyway.


Where have I heard this before?

Stop theorizing.
Write lots of software.
Learn from your mistakes.
Quantity always trumps quality. Thatâ€™s why the one bit of advice I always give aspiring bloggers is to pick a schedule and stick with it. Itâ€™s the only advice that matters, because until youâ€™ve mentally committed to doing it over and over, you will not improve. You canâ€™t.

When it comes to software, the same rule applies. If you arenâ€™t building, you arenâ€™t learning. Rather than agonizing over whether youâ€™re building the right thing, just build it. And if that one doesnâ€™t work, keep building until you get one that does.

Iâ€™ve been unhappy with every single piece of software Iâ€™ve ever released. Partly because, like many software developers, Iâ€™m a perfectionist. And then, there are inevitably Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ problems:


Yes, you did a ton of things wrong on this project. But you also did a ton of things wrong that you donâ€™t know about yet. And thereâ€™s no other way to find out what those things are until you ship this version and get it in front of users and customers. I think Donald Rumsfeld put it best:
In the face of the inevitable end-of-project blues â€” rife with compromises and totally unsatisfying quick fixes and partial soutions â€” you could hunker down and lick your wounds. You could regroup and spend a few extra months fixing up this version before releasing it. You might even feel good about yourself for making the hard call to get the engineering right before unleashing yet another buggy, incomplete chunk of software on the world.

Unfortunately, this is an even bigger mistake than shipping a flawed version.

nstead of spending three months fixing up this version in a sterile, isolated lab, you could be spending that same three month period listening to feedback from real live, honest-to-god, annoyingdedicated users of your software. Not the software as you imagined it, and the users as you imagined them, but as they exist in the real world. You can turn around and use that directed, real world feedback to not only fix all the sucky parts of version 1, but spend your whole development budget more efficiently, predicated on hard usage data from your users.

Now, Iâ€™m not saying you should release crap. Believe me, weâ€™re all perfectionists here. But the real world can be a cruel, unforgiving place for us perfectionists. Itâ€™s saner to let go and realize that when your software crashes on the rocky shore of the real world, disappointment is inevitable Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ but fixable! Whatâ€™s important isnâ€™t so much the initial state of the software â€” in fact, some say if you arenâ€™t embarrassed by v1.0 you didnâ€™t release it early enough â€” but what you do after releasing the software.
