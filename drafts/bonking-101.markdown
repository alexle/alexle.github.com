Bonking 101: How To Overcome The Wall
10-02-2014

In endurance races, athletes pace themselves largely by feel. 

n other words, perception of effort is the feeling of activity in the brain that stimulates muscle work; it is not the feeling of muscle work itself.

When experienced endurance athletes race at a familiar distance, perceived effort tends to increase linearly until it reaches a maximal level near the finish line. But perceived effort is subjective, and for this reason, what is considered maximal changes by circumstance.

You never know how much your next race is going to hurt. Perception of effort is mysterious.

The athleteøs conscious awareness of how far away the finish line sits also affects how a given level of perceived effort is interpreted and used. A runner who experiences a certain level of effort at the 4K mark of a 10K race might panic and slow down, whereas a runner who experiences the same effort level at the 7K point of a 10K race might get a shot of confidence and speed up.

These calculations, in turn, are strongly influenced by past experience. Through experience, athletes learn how they should feel at various points in a race of a given distance. An experienced athlete enters each race with preprogrammed expectations about how she can expect to feel at various points. Any mismatch between how she expects to feel and how she actually feels will cause her to adjust her pace accordingly.



Do you know how long it takes to run, swim or cycle through your fuel stores? Though the timing varies and depends on the sport, environmental conditions and nutrition that follows it takes 1 to 3 hours to use up your fuel stores.

It's during this time period that your body begins to experience muscle glycogen depletion, which leads to fatigue. That's when you "hit the wall" or "bonk." 

When this happens you can't focus on the exercise task at hand. You may experience lightheadedness, poor concentration, irritability and even become disoriented during exercise. This makes exercise harder, and coordination and judgment suffers, which leads to poor performance.
Don't let "the bonk" ruin your chance to achieve a PR or cross the finish line strong. Learn why it happens so you can avoid it at your next event.

Why You "Hit the Wall"
Blood glucose, which is maintained by your liver's glycogen stores, is your brain's only fuel source. When your brain isn't fueled, you can't perform. Carbohydrates replenish and fuel your muscle and liver glycogen stores. But don't be fooled: Carbo-loading the night before the race doesn't prevent bonking.

Proper nutrition needs to be practiced daily to provide your body and brain with the energy it needs to perform. This energy should come from a combination of carbohydrate, protein and fat in the days and hours leading up the event.

Here are seven ways to ensure you get all the energy you need to avoid the wall and run straight through to the finish line.


1. You'll burn roughly 400 to 600 calories per hour during your run, but your body can absorb only 240 to 280 calories per hour. You'll never dig out of this deficit, but eating early and often will keep you from bonking. Early on, you can survive on gels and other carbs, but after four hours, add one part protein to four parts carbs (a mix found in most sports bars), says Sunny Blende, M.S., a sports nutritionist and ultrarunner from Sausalito, California.

2. Few of us can stomach 10 gels or energy bars, so finding agreeable real food is critical. Blende recommends turkey or PB&J sandwiches, chicken-noodle soup, potatoes, pretzels, and bananas.

3. Long before race day, play around with different water bottles, packs, and drinks in training so you've figured out how to stay hydrated. Many ultras require weigh-ins at aid stations to check hydration status. Your performance suffers if you lose three percent of your body weight in water. Your fluid needs will depend on the weather, your pace, and your sweat rate, but figure a liter per hour, on average, says Blende.

4. Don't forget: Too much water can cause potentially fatal hyponatremia. A watchband that becomes tight is often a sign. To respond to the condition, stop and drink 1/4 cup of water with four bouillon cubes before proceeding, says Blende. Better still, avoid overdrinking and consume salty foods or drinks‚Äìabout 200 to 300 milligrams per hour, says Blende. If it's hot, consider taking sodium tablets, such as Succeed S!Caps.


How They Work

Your body uses two primary sources of fuel to feed the muscles when you‚Äôre running ‚Äî fat and carbohydrate. Fat is a largely abundant resource, but is broken down into usable energy slowly, making it an ineffective fuel source when running anything faster than about 60-70% of your VO2max (roughly equivalent to your aerobic threshold or marathon pace).

Therefore, your body relies on carbohydrate as its primary fuel source when racing. Generally, the faster you run, the greater the percentage of your fuel will come from carbohydrates. The problem with carbohydrate is that we can only store a limited amount in our muscles ‚Äî even when you load up. Typically, we can store about 90 minutes of muscle glycogen when running at half marathon pace and about 2 hours worth when running at marathon pace. So, if you‚Äôre not an elite athlete, you‚Äôll be running out of muscle glycogen long before you cross the finish line.

Simply speaking, energy gels are designed to replenish carbohydrate stores that are depleted when running. Sounds like energy gels are a savior, right?

Unfortunately, energy gels don‚Äôt provide a simple one-to-one replacement (something you won‚Äôt read on the label of your favorite gel) because the glycogen we ingest from gels doesn‚Äôt always make its way to the working muscles. So why use them?

Why use them?

Because carbohydrate is stored in both the muscles and the blood, your performance on race day relies on using the glycogen stored in the muscle. For glycogen to make its way to the muscles, it must first be digested, make it‚Äôs way through the intestinal wall, and then absorbed by the muscles. This process takes time and isn‚Äôt very efficient.

However, gels will often ‚Äúwake you up‚Äù in a very noticeable way because our brain only runs on the glucose stored in the blood. As the muscles start to absorb more blood glucose, the brain gets less glucose and starts to get hazy (you‚Äôve probably noticed this feeling on your long runs, or if you‚Äôve gone for a run without eating enough). Often, a gel will wake you up and help the mind feel energized, but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily prevent the bonk in your legs.

In summary, energy gels help replenish the glycogen and calories you‚Äôre burning when racing hard. However, they aren‚Äôt very efficient or a simple one-to-one replacement, so timing and frequency are critical factors to avoiding the bonk.

When it comes to how your body works, the main issue with the "time in the bank" strategy concerns the use of fuelñspecifically, whether you burn glycogen or fat. As anyone who's hit the wall knows, one of the limiting factors in marathon performance is how efficiently you can burn fat instead of carbohydrates for energy. Once you burn through your available carbohydrate stores, your performance will suffer, most notably from "bonking" or running out of fuel.

Unfortunately, the faster you run, the greater the percentage of fuel and energy that comes from carbohydrates. Therefore, by starting faster than goal pace and putting "time in the bank," you're actually burning through your available carbohydrate stores faster, and you will almost certainly run out of fuel and crash.
