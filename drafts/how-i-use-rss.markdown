I’m currently using a feed reader to stay on top of new information in my field and areas that are interesting to me. I use Feedly but any feed reader will work.

The way it works is you add “feeds” of information that is important to you. Then when new items get added to those feeds, they show up in your feed reader for you to review. It’s a similar concept to using email, but instead of messages from people, you are getting items of content to learn.

Choosing what to subscribe to will depend on your field. There are a lot of options:

Newsletters
Blogs
YouTube channels
Twitter accounts
Facebook pages
Subreddits
Hacker News
Google alerts
etc.
For example, here are some of the feeds I have in my feed reader for my interests and field of software development:

Having a feed reader is only valuable if you actually review it. If you subscribe to too many things where it is overwhelming and you stop using it, it loses its value. So I’d recommend only subscribing to the most important feeds to you - so that you can get through them all each day.

So for example, I currently get about 5-10 new feed items a day. If it starts getting noisier than this, I unsubscribe from feeds so that it stays manageable.

To be clear, I still use some Twitter accounts and subreddits etc. under the hood of my feed reader (you can subscribe to these things via RSS). But instead of going to all those sites/apps manually I aggregate them in a feed reader. I like doing this for a few reasons:

All my learning input is in one place (videos, articles, social feeds, email newsletters etc.)
There are fewer distractions (no logging into different accounts, no notifications bugging you on your phone, no social features begging for your attention, fewer advertisements, etc.)
There is less data tracking - I’m in complete control of what I see and share without having to log in to sites and give them my information.
Once you hear about something, you have to actually use it for it to stick and be helpful for you.

The way you go about this will vary depending on your field. So for me, as a software developer, as I read through my feed reader I often have things I want to try out. So I open up my code editor and try out some of what I’m reading. I’ll tinker with new libraries, syntax, and algorithms until I get it and it sticks.



In my early years as a programmer, I spent more time consuming RSS feeds than actually doing real work and practicing my craft. This lead to a period where I wasn’t growing as much as I wanted to or knew I was capable of. Over time, I realized how much time I was wasting reading - instead of doing - and decided I needed a change.

Since then, I’ve evolved an RSS workflow that helps me consume great content without drowning in the vast ocean of information generated every day.

Browse headlines for all of my RSS feeds through Feedly. Typically, this is done on my iPhone while I wait in line at Chipotle, the grocery store, or the bank.
Long-press feeds that pique my interest to send to Instapaper. I don’t read the article at this time, I just save it for later.
Repeat for a given period of time. Usually one week.
Find a quiet place and consume all of the articles saved over the past several days. I try to do this every Saturday.
I’ve found this to be a much more approachable way to consume RSS. Do I occasionally miss items? Yes. But, not nearly as many as I would by ignoring RSS in the first place.

On any given week, I consume 20-30 great articles in batch mode. I feel like I stay well read in the goings on in my industry and various other areas I’m interested in. Best of all, this technique stays out of my way and allows me to get the work done that matters.



What role does Pocket play in your day-to-day?
I love to batch-read articles. Throughout the day, I’m focused on doing my work. When I run into something I want to read, I save it to Pocket and read when I decide. I think Pocket is about being in control of your attention. If you run into a good article, you don’t immediately have to read it. Get on with your work. Don’t be distracted. Save the article and read it when you make time for reading. That’s how I do it.
