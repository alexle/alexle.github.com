	“There I was, in the Olympic village, walking around with other athletes, eating amongst them in the cafeteria. And I realised, these people, there’s nothing special about them, other than the fact that they’ve worked their butts off to get where they are.” In the same way, Scott had been working her whole life to join that elite club of athletic titans. “I want people to know that I’m not like a superhero or something,” Scott says. “I don’t love working out every day; there are days when I don’t wanna work out either, and I wanna eat a doughnut too!” For Scott, running is her job. But there are days when she doesn’t feel like getting up and doing her job. There are days when everything hurts and the workout is especially tough. But it’s that constant push that puts her where she is today. “In track and field it’s all about hard work and I think you can create your own success,” she says. “Someone could say, ‘Dominique is really lucky’, but I think that I’ve worked really hard, and from that hard work, those successes have come.”


	You Have To Set Goals — And Chase Them Fiercely “I’d definitely say my goals motivate me in a hard workout. Every season I write new goals for myself; something that excites me, that seems a little bit hard but not totally out there,” she says. But on the down days, even her goals don’t work. Take two weeks ago, when she had to wake up early to go for her morning run. But it was cold, she was alone, and she didn’t want to trudge along in the frost. So she drove to a local coffee shop, started her run there, and told herself that when she came back, she’d spoil herself with a café latte. “Sometimes you need to do that, you need to find a way to motivate yourself,” she says





## How I Got Into Running ##

For the first time, I found myself constantly asking, Why should anyone care about running? Why is this important? And while those motivations might seem self-evident to long-time runners, as an adult now charged with guiding and nurturing children, I strongly feel that having a compelling and healthy answer to those questions is vitally important. Here’s why. Those answers will dictate whether running is a positive, healthy energy in one’s life or potentially a negative, self-destructive force.

This is also true amongst the population of trail ultrarunners. People are drawn to ultrarunning not only for the scenery and challenge, but also for how it makes us feel. We’re attracted to the supercharged energy of these epic events that strip us all bare, yet fill us with energy and strength. We seek experiences that create powerful emotional bonds among everyone involved. Indeed running, the solitary activity and the community of runners, can create a lifeforce that can nourish us.


, I liked the idea of an activity that was cheaper than gym membership, could be done almost anywhere and fit easily into the weekly routine.


This may sound like bragging, but I need to remind myself why I do what I do. Sometimes I enjoy running, but mostly I endure it. I frequently hate it. As for the much-touted “runner’s high”, the closest I come most days is a panted: “Thank Christ that’s over.”
