Our dog passed away last week. He was 15 1/2 years old. 

We got Mikko in 2001 as a puppy. He was chosen from a litter of 3 puppies. One puppy was described as "XXXX" by the breeder. Another as "YYYY".

The last puppy was the "the lazy one". My sister immediately said "I want THAT one" and Mikko became a part of our family.

We couldn't have asked for a better



Didn't like wearing a collar, but he loved his doggie scarf   mom wore one sometimes, and he loved to follow her around and show off his too 

He was a curious dog

 fearless, never afraid to charge into battle with dogs 10x his size. Never understood since no snout.. Would have gotten destroyed 
 
 hated going to the vet, shiver at front door. Somehow he just knew

 He really struggled his last week. Laid down

  Dottie used to weigh almost 20 pounds; she now weighs six. Her back legs are weak, and she slides a little when she jumps onto surfaces. She’s tired almost all the time, and she no longer runs to the door to greet me when I return from the outside world, as she habitually did for most of the six years we’ve spent together.
