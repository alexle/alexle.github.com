I’m scratching my own itch a bit but, more importantly for me, I wanted to ship something.

I’ve fallen for all the classic procrastination pitfalls: the app isn’t good enough, it’s not finished, no-one will like it, someone else is doing it better already, people will laugh, it doesn’t look right..
