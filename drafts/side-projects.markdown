Side projects are a great way to grow as a developer, both personally and professionally. They let get out of your comfort zone, learn new skills, and exercise your creative muscles. But it can be hard to get anything done while juggling a day job, kids, friends, family, and countless other commitments. In the past, I’ve tried to cram side project work into the cracks between other items in my calendar. It was frustrating at best; completely ineffective at worst. I constantly felt like I was shortchanging the projects I was most passionate about.

Over the last two months, I’ve taken a different approach. I’ve been cultivating a daily side project habit. Each and every morning, I do something to push my side projects forward – even if I only have 15 minutes to spare. I’ve seen great results, so far. And I’ve learned that a small, focused task, done daily, beats a sporadic effort every time.


But side projects benefit your personal career. They provide you with a chance to experiment and learn new techniques that your day job may not allow. They also provide you with the opportunity to widen your skills into new areas and roles. Maybe in your day job you are a designer, but your side project might provide the perfect opportunity to learn some PHP. Finally, side projects allow you to work without constraints. This is something many of us crave and being able to set our own agenda is freeing. However, it is also a challenge. We have to learn how to deliver when there is nobody sitting over our shoulder pushing us to launch.
All of this knowledge from personal projects has a transformative effect that will change your career. It will increase your chance of getting a job and show your employer how valuable you are. It may also convince your employer to create a job that better utilises your skills, as we did for Rob. Rob used to be a project manager, but when we saw his passion and knowledge for mobile we created a new role focusing on that. Of course, this leads us to the obvious question: how can we have time away from the computer if we should also be working on side projects?

Importance of Side Projects
MAY 29TH, 2011
Side projects are important for a few reasons. Programming is a creative process. Side projects allow programming without deadlines or restraints. Side projects allow programming in an exploratory way.

Explore new technologies

Every day there are more and more bleeding edge technologies coming out. A side project is a great place to try them out. There‚Äôs no reason to worry about bugs or performance issues because it‚Äôs just a side project. You‚Äôre not depending on the project to pay your bills. It‚Äôs ok if the website crashes.

Creating from scratch

Most jobs I‚Äôve had so far were mostly maintenance work. Adding new features, fixing bugs, troubleshooting performance problems, refactoring existing code. Though I‚Äôve built more than a few applications from scratch, it only takes me a couple months to lay the foundation, and then I‚Äôm in maintenance mode again.

Side projects require creating from scratch on a regular basis. I love this step because I get to step back and take everything I‚Äôve learned and put that into creating a new (and improved) project.

Good enough to launch

Working on a side project is also an exercise in avoiding analysis paralysis. If you‚Äôre starting from scratch, the possibilities are endless. A good way to avoid this is to make your short list of must have features, and then launch a beta when you have those features. A so called minimum viable product.

Staving off burnout

Work on your passion. Work on something that is fun. If you‚Äôre a developer who is about to burnout because you don‚Äôt enjoy what you‚Äôre working on, try creating your own side project. It will remind you why programming is fun.

Keeping your skillset current

Maybe you‚Äôre working with old technology at your day job. Maybe you‚Äôre bored with your current skillset and want to learn some new skills. Side are a great way to keep current with emerging trends in software. Never tried node.js? Great, make a small side project using it. All of a sudden you have something to show off as proof of your newly acquired skills.

Complete your side project

One of the problems with side projects is that they can remain incomplete. You may start on a project with all the gusto in the world, but then it‚Äôs two months later and you can‚Äôt remember the last time you worked on the side project. Nevertheless it‚Äôs important to push forward and complete the project. On that note, I‚Äôm off to do some work on my side project.

Keep learning - This is the most obvious, but crucial. You need to keep learning, read books and tutorials, take classes in your off time. Spend your lunch breaks or get up a little earlier in the morning. Learn something other than what you‚Äôre doing every day at work.

Get out of your comfort zone - What you‚Äôre doing now might be fun and totally awesome, but will you be doing it next year? Two years? There‚Äôs no way to tell so don‚Äôt get too comfortable. Do something crazy and wild. Jump the fence and explore something new. Are you a LAMP guy? Download Visual Studio Express and learn to build an ASP site. Microsoft Devs, do the opposite, download XAMMP and build a php site. Or choose neither and Build a Ruby on Rails site, or download Node.js. Do something unfamiliar to you.

Keep up on your skills - You need to broaden your horizons to other areas, but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with focusing on your bread and butter skills. Improve and evolve your code and the way you write software. When the newest stuff comes out, learn it as quickly as you can even if you don‚Äôt use it. Try new techniques and methods, they change every day. If you‚Äôre writing the same kind of code you were 6 months ago, you‚Äôre not moving fast enough.

Because I‚Äôve come to believe that all great software is written three times. The first time you write it, it‚Äôs to see if your idea can work at all. It‚Äôs the digital equivalent of scratching something out on the back of the envelope, leaving out the fancy stuff and just concentrating on the basic feature or algorithm. Once you figure out that yes, this might be a good way to solve the problem, then you write the code a second time, to ‚Äúmake it work.‚Äù But it‚Äôs the third time you write the code, when you‚Äôve had the opportunity to learn from the mistakes from the ‚Äútry to make it work‚Äù phase, when your application will be the best it can be. (Well, almost. There‚Äôs often a 3.1, too. 

Itís easy to become stuck in the routine of a day job and lose sight of the interests that truly invigorate you. Side projects are an incredible outlet to tap into your passion, scratch an itch and most importantly, they are the best way to start working with people to figure out if youíre a good potential team. Even if your project never materializes, what you learn during the process is more important.
