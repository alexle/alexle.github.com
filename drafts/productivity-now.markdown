You're tired from work. You're not in the right mood. It'd be easier on the weekend. Procrastination isn't just distraction. It's the thought that you'll do it better if you do it later. But that's rarely true.

Most of us have an arsenal of excuses that convince us we'll do a better job if we wait. After all, you won't want to do the dishes after you just got home after working for ten hours, right? Except you also won't want to do them when you're cozy in your bed or while you're relaxing on the couch. In short, the "right" moment doesn't exist. As business blog Inc. explains:

Unless you're in the middle of delivering a baby, chances are later won't be substantially better than now. 

Mark Twain once said that if the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that that is probably the worst thing that is going to happen to you all day long.


Mark Twain is often credited with saying, "Eat a live frog the first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day." (In truth, that was coined by Nicolas Chamfort and only linked to Mark Twain long after reports of Twain's death were no longer an exaggeration.) P

Your ìfrogî is your biggest, most important task, the one you are most likely to procrastinate on if you donít do something about it. It is also the one task that can have the greatest positive impact on your life and results at the moment.



Deal with something once. Do it now. Then it‚Äôs off your mind, and you can fully focus on the next matter.

We put off small decisions and tasks for later, and they pile up, weighing on us at the back of our minds, pulling on us until we collapse under the weight of ‚Äúlater‚Äù.

Try dealing with it immediately.

If you open an email, make a decision on it immediately. Schedule the appointment in your calendar, reply, do a small task it requires, or if it takes too long, then you can put it on a to-do list ‚Äî but avoid this if possible. David Allen suggests a two-minute rule: if the task can be done in less than two minutes, do it now. I suggest five minutes, even up to 10, as that means you have one less thing to worry about..

Never say "I'll finish it up tomorrow" or "I'll make up for it by coming in early/staying late/working the weekend".  This is an easy trap to get into, where you keep incurring time debt until at some point you realize you're now three weeks behind on a task that should have taken two days.  This is like racking up credit card bills assuming you can pay them off later.  Which is fine, until "later" arrives and you've only accumulated more debt.

Do not overpromise to make up for poor productivity.  There's a tendency when we're falling behind to try to overcompensate with future promises.  "When I'm done, it'll be AWESOME" or "I know I'm late, but I'm positive I'll be done by Monday".  By doing those things we just build more debt we can't pay off, and that will eventually lead to a catastrophic melt down when the super final absolutely last deadline date shows up.  Just get shit done, don't talk about how you're going to get shit done.
A friend of mine's father has a great quote: "Son, i don't wake up every day and go to a place called fun. I wake up and go to a place called work". 

I came to the realization that my definition of a ìgood dayî was now defined by how much I got done, and not necessarily by what I had accomplished. 

Before you turn off your computer for the night the question to ask is not how busy you were during the day, but how much closer you came to accomplishing your most important goals.


We have a limited amount of energy and willpower to apply each day.
