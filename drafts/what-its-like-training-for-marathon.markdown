What It's Like Training For A Marathon
09-29-2014



They say that the hardest part of running a marathon is training for a marathon.

All those Sundays spent slogging your guts on pavements and in parks while everyone else is in bed.

All those injuries and aching legs.

All those weeks spent ordering soda water in pubs rather than beer.

Everything about it is hard ø and thatøs before you get anywhere near the start line.




Before launching into marathon training, it’s important to respect what is actually involved in preparing for the big day and the impact marathon training can have on your body, your lifestyle and your family life. It’s not a decision to be made lightly.

When coaching runners for marathon distance, I stress the importance of not outrunning the love for running by putting too much physical or mental pressure on the body just to be able to earn the title of becoming a marathoner.

I truly believe the marathon should be there to be enjoyed as a celebration of hard work, rather than an experiment to see how far one can run on a given day. There is no point completing a marathon and then retiring from running feeling burnt out, injured or disappointed.

The people who enjoy the marathon are those who put the work in, respect the distance and leave nothing to chance on race day. They know their limits and work within them.

There will be sacrifices along the way, a lot of focus, dedication and discipline, and the possibility of some tears, doubts and setbacks along the training journey. A good coach and training programme prepares you for these ups and downs and makes you mentally as well as physically ready for the distance.


1. Aerobic Workout: The long run is all about running at a consistent and comfortable effort to build fat-burning exnzymes, cardiovascular endurance, and time on your feet. One of my coaching strategies is to build the long run from where you are, gradually, and once you hit 14 miles, alternate a longer run with a shorter run that progresses to marathon race effort and beyond. The secret sauce is in running your long runs by effort and your body to avoid over- (too quickly) and under- (too slowly) training. If you can pass "the talk test" and are able to speak in sentences, you are in the right zone--which, by the way, is also known as "the happy zone."

2. Threshold Workouts: The threshold is where your body begins to use more glycogen for energy and less fat, and when you train at and slightly above it, you can "raise the roof," so to speak, so you can run faster at easier efforts (pretty cool). There are several workouts that you can fit in this slot, but my go-to is a variety pack of three workouts. 

How to find "threshold effort": You know you're at this effort when things start to feel uncomfortable, and it's hard to talk. If you can get out one word responses, you're there. If you can tell me what you did last night, you need to pick things up. If you're gasping for air, slow it down. Because this is a physiologically based run, it works best when running by your effort rather than a pace; as you gain fitness, your pace will improve or you may slow down when the elements are challenging (heat and humidity).

3. Hills/intervals:
HIIT (High Intensity Interval Workouts): These workouts may be the hardest effort-wise, but they also make the most dramatic changes in aerobic fitness, speed, metabolism and caloric burn, and overall fitness. My favorite HIIT Workout is: 


discovered something great about yourself, the time at which you found renewed strength, the time you thought all was lost

Myth #1: I could never run a marathon

Bologna. Pronounced BULL LONEY. 

I am pretty sure anyone can complete a marathon, given they have proper training and are cleared by their doctor.

1. Running becomes a *chore*.

Feeling like your former favorite hobby is now more like a drag is normal, especially since you're spending quite a lot of your time on the road. 

On the days you run, you dread it.
On the days you can't run, you feel sad and guilty.

 when I ‚Äúneed‚Äù to clock in a certain amount of miles because some training plan says I need to. I want to run for the pure enjoyment of running, not because I have to but because I WANT to. Because I enjoy it and because of how I feel afterwards. I do not enjoy waking up at the crack of dawn to run 20 miles, knowing that I will be sore, exhausted and limping for the following 2-3 days.

2. Consumes your life.

Say goodbye to your social life. Run work eat sleep. Repeat. 

Your free time becomes all about the race: Friends want to go out of town for the weekend? Have a birthday dinner you can't miss that just happens to be the same day as your midweek run? Scheduling your time becomes a balancing act between can't-miss social and work events with better-not-miss 15-milers. Try as you might, you will have to say no to a fun event or two during your marathon months.

"Doing an epic endurance race defines who you are at that time in your life," says Nicole DeBoom, a professional triathlete for six years and 2004 Ironman Wisconsin winner. "It's not something you just decide to do and then train for a few weeks and hit the starting line. You have to shift your entire life around to prepare; the bigger the race, the more meaningful it is."

I don‚Äôt want anything to take over my life. I‚Äôm all for making sacrifices and devoting oneself to something, but I‚Äôm also a fan of quality of life. I‚Äôm not saying my life is lower quality when I‚Äôm marathon training, but I am saying marathon training has a way of taking over your time and if you‚Äôve run one, I bet you‚Äôre nodding your head. If not, imagine planning your eating, sleeping and social schedules around your runs. Running a marathon requires months of training. What you eat, how you sleep, when and how you socialize are all dependent on the training schedule. I believe that it can be very fulfilling for some to make sacrifices to devote themselves completely to marathons or other ventures, but I find that I value a more balanced lifestyle (surprised?!). Training for a marathon is nearly all-consuming, and when I‚Äôve got clients to care for, friends to keep up with, family to visit and blogs to write, I can‚Äôt afford to let training take over my life.

love exercising, but not when I‚Äôm overdoing it. Lastly, for the record, I‚Äôm not an exercise Grinch! I still love exercise! I spent my college years not only studying nutrition, but exercise as well and for a reason: I love it! I believe there are significant benefits to an active lifestyle. I feel awesome when I‚Äôm active, but not when I overdo it. It‚Äôs the chronic, repetitive, daily endurance activity that I believe is counterproductive.

So what do I recommend doing for exercise? I feel great after getting back into HIIT (high intensity interval training) ‚Äì the stuff that really boosts your metabolism and doesn‚Äôt require great lengths of time. I look ridiculous when I do it but I feel awesome. I set my stopwatch and do 45 second interval sets of intense squat jumps, stair stepping, push ups, jumping jacks, lunges, etc with 45 seconds on and a 10 second break in-between sets. I do this for 15 minutes or so, then I stretch and shower. I switch it up by attending my favorite weight lifting class at the gym once a week along with a cardiokickboxing and pilates class mixed in. I still run but my runs are shorter and I follow the same interval training approach (I usually sprint for 45 seconds, rest for 30, repeat.) Occasionally I might do a longer run (maybe 6-9 miles) but no longer as part of my regular exercise regimen. I LIVE for my active lifestyle of paddle boarding, outdoor rock-climbing, hiking, skiing, rollerblading and biking. I don‚Äôt need to pound the pavement to be healthy and I think I‚Äôm healthier without it.

You may lose friends along the way. There have been people in my life that have judged my decisions to not drink, to go home early, to get up early, to skip social engagementsøall in the name of a goal race. The marathon is no exception. If you have a goal, stick to itøyou never know what strangers you may be inspiring while others are choosing to walk away.

There's an aspect that isn't mentioned much and that's the decline in your social life when training for ultras. If you're used to meeting the friends every friday/saturday night at the bar, chances are you're going to have to learn to tell them no. I'm not saying that ultra training makes you a hermit but it really does limit things like get togethers, holidays, and special occasions when you know you've got to be up at 4:30 am the next day to put in your second long run of the weekend while all your friends are having a good time. You've got to choose what's most important. Strains on relationships are very common. If you are married/dating/whatever, it's going to be something that causes stressful situations. People who don't run just don't understand this and a lot of the time, it causes tension. Learn to work with this if you have someone you are close to. Explain to them what doing this means and be upfront that it's going to be rather inconvenient for them at times. If they support you, they'll deal with it. Second to this, ultra training also allows you to realize who's most important in your life. You'll have absolutely zero time for negativity and bullshit drama. Before training, now's the time to get rid of the asshole friend that holds you back, or the family member who you'd be better off without. Nobody needs that shit anyways so now you'll have a good excuse to cut them off.


3. You will have meltdowns. It's an emotional roller coaster ride.

Feel unstoppable. Then no way possible. Doubts..

at some point midway through your training plan, you're going to feel like giving up. Mine came halfway through a 20-mile long run the first time I trained for a marathon; I couldn't understand why running felt so hard, and I couldn't imagine being able to run a full 26.2 race. When it happens, recognize it, then move on. Some runs are bad, many are hard, but every one will help you get closer to your goal of finishing your race.

The feelings of the raceñthe lows you battle through, the highs you cruise through, the physical and mental limits you testñmake that candy even sweeter."

4. You can actually *gain* weight.

It may not seem possible ‚Äî you're constantly in the gym and you just spent two hours running through thousand of calories over the weekend ‚Äî but it's true for many. Athlete-like training equals an athlete-like appetite, and while those bulging leg muscles are good news for your race time, they may not exactly make fitting into your skinny jeans any easier. The good news is that you'll probably be healthier than you were when you started training, so don't let vanity discourage you from accomplishing an important goal.

nd it‚Äôs natural to think ‚ÄúI just ran 20 miles, I deserve that entire pan of brownies.‚Äù And it‚Äôs not unusual to overdo it during the week since you are likely doing some form of exercise every day and feeling hungry and entitled to indulge. 
it's not license to eat dozens of cookies.


5. It is brutally hard.

Leadville is actually all that it‚Äôs hyped to be and maybe then some‚Äîbrutally hard, amazingly beautiful, very humbling, a bit of a road race, more of a mountain bike race than you think, and the kind of experience that seeps under your skin and becomes a little (or for some folks a big) part of you.

Leadville, you‚Äôre for real. And it was real. I can't say I'll ever be back but I also know you'll be with me, deep inside, for the rest of my days wherever I go.

miserable, accept the pain and carry on.

every 400m is a little battle with yourself, It's all those little battles with yourself that are the most satisfying to win."

6. Wait. Why do we do this?

"Signing up for big races is often made in a burst of enthusiasm and excitement, but the training isn't always going to be fun," 

. "You're so emotional during your first shot at going big because you truly don't know if you can do it," says DeBoom. I cried when I nailed a solo 90-mile ride; the spring winds were totally draining, and I saw just one other cyclist the entire time. "Way to get it the fñk done, Dimity!" I yelled to myself around mile 88 as my eyes welled with happiness. 

tears..

After 4 years of always training for something, I stopped running back in July. I just failed my first attempt at a 70.3 and I was burnt out.
It's pretty damn liberating to not feel like I just have to run or else I won't hit my goal. I recently discovered a love for Pilates. I lift heavy when I want as well, without fear of being "too sore".
I know ill get back into endurance training eventually, but this time i'll be stronger than ever. My body is changing and I'm not hungry all the damn time.
Try it.

Shorter interval work is more effective than long-distance runs for weight management and gaining fitness. Interval training won't set you up to run a great marathon, but it will make you a baller at the 5-K, an event that requires strength, speed, power, and endurance combined. By making the 5-K your focus, your training plan will actually line up with what's best for your overall health. Excuse me, what? Yes.

With a growing obsession over distance races, and a focus on completion rather than competition, 5-Ks have somehow lost a lot of their badassiness. They have become little more than a gateway drug for marathons. The prevailing mentality is to go longer and longer and longer, until one day you find yourself down six toe-nails, dressed head to toe in compression gear, contemplating your first 50-K ultra over a morning bowl of chia seeds. Stop! Listen to me.

The 5-K is freaking awesome. It encourages you to develop a combination of endurance, speed, and strength. You can train for it and still have a life. You can race one every weekend and still be able to walk normally. If people ran more 5-Ks, I'm positive the average life satisfaction of humans would increase dramatically.

4. Competition vs. Completion

The satisfaction in a marathon comes with completion under duress. You reach the point where you aren't sure you will finish, and then somehow you do. It's an amazing feeling, but it's only one way to experience racing. In a 5-K, you know that you are going to finish. Satisfaction comes instead from competing: against yourself, the clock, and others in an intense, concentrated period of time. This adds a whole new depth and richness to your running, regardless of your speed.



RULE #1: RUN SLOW OFTEN
IT'S EASY: Seventy percent of your weekly mileage should be easy miles. Depending on your age and fitness level, your muscles need 30 to 60 hours to recover from a hard effort, says McMillan. (Long, slow runs lasting 1.5 to 2.5 times longer than your average weekday run count as hard efforts due to their duration.) Running super slow and relaxed for one to three days after tough workouts gets blood flowing to muscles, which flushes away broken-down proteins, delivers new proteins to rebuild damaged tissue, and carries carbohydrates to replenish depleted stores in muscle cells. "That gentle exercise bathes muscles in the good stuff they need and removes all the bad stuff caused by the prior training," McMillan says. "And running as part of your recovery makes your body say, 'Oh, I'm still getting this stress—I better build this tissue even stronger.'"

RULE #2: HEED YOUR WATCH—OR LISTEN TO YOUR BODY
IT'S EASY: If you're notoriously bad at going slow enough, plug your easy-run pace into your watch and abide by the beep—at least until you firmly establish how slow should feel. If you're training for a 5-K, aim for a pace just over two minutes slower than goal race pace; if your target event is a marathon, run about one to two minutes slower. (Find your exact easy pace at runnersworld.com/trainingcalculator.) But it is possible to run without an eye (or ear) on the time. "For me, it comes down to the perception of the run being easy," says McMillan. "Could I go farther or faster with no problem?" Running based on feel rather than time allows for variations in weather, wind, and terrain. "The body doesn't know pace, it only knows intensity and duration," McMillan says. "Tuning in to that is really important."
