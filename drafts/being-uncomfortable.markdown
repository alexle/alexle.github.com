Comfort Does Not Equal Happiness
12-29-2015






This, my friends, is the advantage of pain. The more you experience, the more you can handle in the future, and the less it knocks you off your game. For now, the point I want to make is this: if you feel depressed and weak, unable to cope with the difficulties of life, itÕs not because you are a flawed human being. ItÕs because you were unprepared for the pain you are experiencing. The problem, ironically, is that you havenÕt suffered enough. The bottom line?

The degree of success you achieve in life is directly proportional to the amount of pain you can tolerate. If you ever want to accomplish big things like building a successful business, becoming the best in your field, or changing the world in some way, you need to start training yourself to endure the pain all those things require. ItÕll also prepare you for the next time life punches you in the face, which is inevitable.

The only caveat is you have to keep the right mindset. If you respond to pain the wrong way, it makes you weaker, not stronger. LetÕs talk about how to make sure that doesnÕt happenÉ



Honestly, I think the problem is pleasure. Too much pleasure, really. The endless, easy, and innocent pursuit of just Òfeeling goodÓ is birthing a savage soul-eating monster inside me.

HereÕs a snapshot of our typical week right now:
I wake up whenever I want.
I work as much as I want, on whatever and with whomever I want. (my wife works five night shifts a week at a hospital around the corner and IÕm usually at a Starbucks scanning my gold card for $5 drinks).
We eat wherever and whatever we want.
We drink as much as we want.
We travel anywhere we want.
We exercise however (much) we want.
We watch whatever and however much we want.
We believe whatever we want to believe.
We buy anything we want.
We have no commitments.
We have complete and utter freedom.
And IÕve never been more miserable.
DonÕt get me wrong. Like I said, we have fun. Lots of fun. We Òfeel goodÓ all the time. And itÕs certainly not anyone elseÕs fault. And IÕm astoundingly thankful for living in the great free nation of America. But the sense that there must be more than this never seems to go away.



Pleasure Vs. Happiness
¿A life that doesn¿t include hard-won accomplishment and triumph over obstacles may not be a satisfying one. There is something deeply fulfilling¿¿¿even thrilling¿¿¿in doing almost anything difficult extremely well. There is a joy and pride that come from pushing yourself to another level or across a new frontier. A life devoted only to the present¿¿¿to feeling good in the now¿¿¿is unlikely to deliver real fulfillment. The present moment by itself it too small, too hollow. We all need a future. Something beyond and greater than our own present gratification, at which to aim or feel we¿ve contributed.¿¿¿¿The Triple Package
True happiness¿¿¿joy¿¿¿is fundamentally different than momentary pleasure. Not to say momentary pleasure is inherently bad. However, it often gets in the way of something more real and lasting.

Anything worth doing brings a satisfaction that distraction never can. Don¿t give into the resistance. Push through the difficulty. That¿s where a joy that those who stop will never taste.






The choice is yours.

When something sucks, do you quit? Or do you push-through and eventually enjoy the satisfaction of growth and success?

Anything worth doing is going to suck at the beginning. Anything worth doing is meant to require pain and sacrifice. Herein lies the problem facing America, which originally was built on the moral of impulse control. What once used to be a country filled with people sacrificing momentary pleasure for a better future, the overpowering message of today is live for the moment.

And that¿s exactly what people do. They live for this moment. Consequently, when something sucks, or becomes hard, most people quit. Most people indulge themselves in momentary satisfaction at the expense of a better future.

To make matters worse, the twin ¿truth¿ of today¿s culture is love yourself for who you are. The self-esteem movement of the late 20th century is an enormous contributor to America¿s faltering success.

People are taught to love themselves regardless of their performance. Thus, they justify mediocrity. Yet, Asian¿s and other immigrant groups who often are considered to have low self-esteem consistently outperform American¿s who have high self-esteem.

Unlike in other parts of the world where hard work is seen as a virtue, the repeated phrase in America is: ¿Don¿t work too hard!¿ Success these days is to get as much as you can for as little work as possible.




Ask for 100% of what you want 100% of the time. My wife sometimes gets upset at me for not doing something she wanted that she thinks I should¿ve known about. I¿ll then gently remind her that while I have many superpowers, mind-reading is not one of them. We all make this mistake. You might not get all of what you want, of course. But if you don¿t ask for what you want, how will people even know?

Grow your ability to have uncomfortable conversations. This year, I embarked on an uncomfortable conversation challenge, to stretch my comfort zone and to explore any tension I felt with other people. And so I had long conversations with homeless people. I asked a stranger on the street for $10. I asked Lyft drivers, ¿What¿s your dream?¿ I told a senior engineer he intimidated me. I cold called friends out of the blue (which is uncomfortable for me). I had hard conversations with my wife.

What Tim Ferriss wrote feels true, ¿A person¿s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.¿ And each uncomfortable conversation this year has increased my capacity to stay with discomfort, to say what needs to be said.


In his book, Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World, Cal Newport states the following:

¿The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.¿
Without question, we live in the most distracted time in human history. It is almost impossible to remain focused on a single-task for more than a few minutes at a time.








 	Our peak experiences donÕt come during passive moments. Sure, we enjoy reading a book or watching Big Bang Theory or playing a videogame, but these arenÕt the best moments of our lives. Instead, Òthe best moments usually occur when a personÕs body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult or worthwhile.Ó People are happiest when they forget their surroundings to focus on doing their best at something that challenges and interests them. In short, happiness is produced by total engagement in the pursuit of excellence. We can experience flow during activities as basic as riding a bike or as complex as building a bridge.


	Fulfillment does not come from the accomplishment of tasks. Accomplishing something easy is not the same thing as accomplishing something hard. Fulfillment, happiness, comes from progress towards the accomplishment of goals. If you are given the option to choose something easy that you know you will achieve or something hard at which you may fail, choose the latter. Definitely choose the latter if it will help you towards the accomplishment of your goals. Even if you fail, you¿ve made it that much easier for you to try something similarly difficult in the future. You¿ve experienced an exercise in self-efficacy¿¿¿in seeing yourself as capable of trying and someday achieving hard things in the world.





Always choose harder stuff.

When given the option to choose between something challenging and rewarding and something less challenging and less rewarding, always choose the more challenging thing.




4. Embrace All Challenges
One of our core family values is to embrace challenges. We believe that doing hard things is fun. Often in American culture we value comfort. There¿s nothing wrong with that, but solely staying in your comfort zone is boring. When kids work hard and overcome challenging things, it builds confidence in them that translates to the rest of their lives. We do them a disservice if we let them stay in their comfort zones and never know the thrill of persevering through adversity.



She believes that in spite of the pain and the suffering, she wouldn¿t have traded the experience for anything. It brought her closer to her family, made her more appreciative of life, and it reminded her of what really mattered.

Kramer doesn¿t claim that every form of trauma or suffering brings with it a new hidden meaning. She realizes that it¿s more complicated than that. The only point she tries to hit home is that the unwanted and the unexpected doesn¿t always have to be that bad.

The phenomenon that she¿s talking about is actually fairly common, and it¿s based on how the brain reframes stressors. Scientists refer to it as post-traumatic growth (PTG).






Once you get comfortable in your routine, it is hard to shy away from that schedule.

Sure, it is nice to wake up every day and know your day will be just like the one before. Before you know it, it becomes a routine you find yourself being stuck in for years.

There is more to this life than going through the motions; fulfillment and beauty are essential to truly being alive. Every day is a gift, and as clichéd as that is, seeing each day as anything else is an absolute waste of it.

Don¿t get me wrong; routines are good to have in our lives. They provide a structure that is beneficial to us, but when that structure brings about a lack of joy, you should think about changing something.

These changes don¿t have to be as dramatic as dropping it all and traveling (which is never a bad idea), but can be as simple as taking a different route during your commute.

Small simple adjustments can make just as much of an impact on your life. Try new hobbies, cook new recipes spice things up with your lover ¿ anything to break away from the comfort.

You never know where trying something new can spark a new passion, or it might not, but at least you¿ll have tried.

I¿ve witnessed people so comfortable in their daily lives that they remain stagnant in unhappy relationships, stuck in career paths that waste their talents and overall unhappy because of this blanket of comfort they embody.






In fact, if there¿s one thing I¿ve learned from completing over 850 self-assigned comfort zone challenges, it¿s this:

We don¿t stumble accidentally into a wildly fulfilling, deeply satisfying, jaw-dropping life¿ we create it.  And the journey always leads us outside our comfort zone.




The Biggest Mistake Most People Make With Their Comfort Zone

The biggest mistake I see most people make with trying to expand their comfort zone is believing it has to be ¿big¿ or reckless. After 850 comfort zone challenges, I firmly advise the opposite.

Start small.

Simply doing something outside of your ordinary routine is enough to stretch you and wake your brain up.

Consider taking a new way home from work.

Dig out a piece of clothing you bravely purchased but have not worn yet.

Walk up to the next interesting person you see and say, ¿Of all the creative and interesting people I¿ve seen today, you¿re my favorite!¿

Don¿t underestimate the power of tiny opportunities to stretch your comfort zone. These small actions help you meet new people and build your confidence to try bigger comfort zone challenges over time.





The key thing to understand is that most forms of discomfort actually help us grow into our strongest and smartest selves.  However, many of us were raised by loving parents who did so much to make our childhoods comfortable, that we inadvertently grew up to subconsciously believe that we donÕt need discomfort in our lives.  And now we run from it constantly.  The problem with this is that, by running from discomfort, we are constrained to partake in only the activities and opportunities within our comfort zones.  And since our comfort zones are relativity small, we miss out on most of lifeÕs greatest and healthiest experiences, and we get stuck in a debilitating cycle.



WeÕre so used to being coddled. WeÕre so used to having all our basics right next to us. LikeÉI miss my Dr. McCoy Star Trek doll that was right next to my computer.

ButÉitÕs ok to feel bad sometimes. ItÕs ok to miss things sometimes.

Nobody came down and said, Òyou should feel perfect and satisfied all the timeÓ.

I like feeling a little pain. I like feeling a little bit of pain every single day.

ItÕs practice for those moments when big pain comes. And Òbig painÓ is waiting for 100% of us.


Learn to Embrace Discomfort. It is okay to be tired. Or hungry. Or thirsty. I see so many people going for runs, and they have a family buffet wrapped around their waist. You are going to be gone 90 minutes. You don't need a sandwich.




Be uncomfortable for 5 minutes every day

As Eleanor Roosevelt once said, "Do one thing every day that scares you."

Wealthy entrepreneurs and powerful executives didn't get to where they are by living inside their comfort zone. For many of us, risk isn't something we're comfortable with, and that's why taking five minutes out of your day to try something new is so important. Doing this on a regular basis trains your brain to be okay with a challenge or to feel comfortable with putting yourself out there, even if the result is failure.

This could be as simple as trying a new food, asking for help, talking to a new person, or requesting feedback from a peer. It could be something bigger like investing your money or learning how to say "no."


To focus on learning and creating rather than being entertained and distracted.



Discomfort is a form of pain, but it isnÕt a deep pain Ð itÕs a shallow one.  ItÕs the feeling you get when youÕve stepped outside of your comfort zone.  The idea of exercising in many peopleÕs minds, for example, brings discomfort Ð so they donÕt do it.   Eating green vegetables brings discomfort too.  So does meditating, or focusing on a difficult task, or saying no to others.  Of course, these are just examples, because different people find discomfort in different things, but you get the general idea.

The bottom line is most of us donÕt want to be uncomfortable.  So we run from discomfort constantly.  The problem with this is that, by running from discomfort, we are constrained to partake in only the activities and opportunities within our comfort zones.  And since our comfort zones are relativity small, we miss out on most of lifeÕs greatest and healthiest experiences, and we get stuck in a debilitating cycle.



One of the most important skills you can develop in life is being OK with some level of discomfort.  Because the best things are often hard to come by, and if you shy away from difficulty and discomfort, you¿ll miss out on them.

Mastering a new skill is hard.  Building a business is hard.  Writing a book is hard.  A marriage is hard.  Parenting is hard.  Staying in shape is hard.  All are amazing and worth every bit of effort you can muster.

If you get good at doing hard things, you can do anything.

How do you get good at this?  Purposefully do things today that are uncomfortable, and start in small doses.  Try exercising for ten minutes, even if it¿s hard, and repeat this practice every day for a month before increasing your exercise duration by even the slightest margin.  Try journaling or meditating every day for ten minutes.  When you find yourself avoiding discomfort or procrastinating, push yourself just a little bit more, but don¿t do more than ten minutes.  It¿s all about starting small and building a daily ritual that gradually strengthens your mind and body, and allows you to do (larger) hard things effortlessly in the long run.  

You were lied to, when you were told that if you worked enough hours, got enough stuff, and followed enough rules, that youÕd be okay. That youÕd be happy. But now, hopefully, you know the truth: We only find fulfillment when we let go of comfort, when we risk losing everything. ThatÕs what a really good story, and incidentally what a really good life, is all about.

"When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it." -Henry Ford

It's not easy to do things that scare us or that we're not used to. Growing up, we were taught to follow the rules and do what society considers normal. When we stay within our comfort zone, we miss a huge opportunity for growth and adventure. To grow as a person, you have to try new things and figure out if they're right for your life.
But bad runs happen to everyone. ItÕs a normal part of the training cycle. You learn as much from those experiences as the good ones because they force you to dig deep and find mental strength and confidence to persevere. Plus, you come to appreciate the good workouts even more.

I did share a photo and wrote about my bad run on that sunny day. And the outpouring of support was overwhelming. Many people commented that they have felt similarly on recent runs, that they struggle too. But those were status updates I rarely saw.

Maybe we all need to share more of the bad along with the good to show the ups and downs and rich texture of what it means to be a runner, not just the perfect image.

Nothing great ever comes from a comfort zone.  Period. Ð If you want to stunt your growth and feel stuck in the same place forever, keep making excuses.  If, on the other hand, you want to stop feeling trapped, you have to start doing things that make you uncomfortable Ð things you arenÕt very good at.  There is no excuse for remaining stuck.  There is no excuse for doing the same exact mundane things over and over again.  Life is too short.  Ask yourself if what youÕre doing today is getting you closer to where you want to be tomorrow.  What a disgrace it would be for you to grow old without ever seeing the beauty and strength of your full potential.
ccording to Ferriss, feeling comfortable at your job can be a trap. "Itâ€™s worse to tolerate your job than to hate it because, if the pain is painful enough, youâ€™ll make a change," he says. "But if itâ€™s tolerable mediocrity, and youâ€™re like, â€˜Well, you know it could be worse. At least Iâ€™m getting paid.â€™ Then you wind up in a job that is slowly killing your soul and youâ€™re allowing that to happen. Comfort can be a very, very dangerous thing."

 And I think thatâ€™s what more people need. Its certainly what I needed. I was doing extremely well financially in mid-2004. And then I had a long term girlfriend break-up with me because of my 7am â€“ 9pm schedule. It was a huge eye-opener for me. And I needed that pain, or I would not have changed my behavior."

No, I'm not crazy. 


No matter how fast you are, it all comes down to commitment, hard work perseverance and passion. If you have those things and have the courage to test yourself from time to time, you never know how things might turn out or whom you might inspire. Reach for the stars; you might only get one or two or maybe 10, but you won’t get any if you don’t reach for them.

Sore
Pushing myself to limits 

Times of transition are strenuous, but I love them. They are an opportunity to purge, rethink priorities, and be intentional about new habits. We can make our new normal any way we want

Financial hardship is what makes all of us more fiscally responsible individuals. I would much rather have someone go through financial hardship, learn her lessons, and make progress towards improvement than never experience anything bad.

When I was interviewing recent college graduates for a position that paid over $100,000 a year, I was very wary of the perfect 4.0 GPA students. Of course they worked hard and were smart. But I was much more interested in hearing about how they failed and overcame adversity, because Wall Street is a brutal business where only the strong survive. Those with 3.5 GPAs (B+) turned out to be much better colleagues who were much more appreciative of their opportunities than those who had 4.0s.

I wonâ€™t lie to you. This experience isnâ€™t exactly what I imagined it would be. But Iâ€™d still get on that plane a year ago. Maybe we need to justify this move, but Iâ€™m convinced we needed a change of geography to facilitate a change of direction. Itâ€™s not the fantasy. But ultimately, I have to believe itâ€™s richer and more satisfying. Iâ€™d rather be living in an honest, hands-on wayâ€”even when itâ€™s uncomfortableâ€”than let life happen to me.

And as Iâ€™m discovering, the big adventure is not a place, an experience, or a plane ticket. The real big adventure is the thrill of a life (any life, anywhere) thatâ€™s lived honestly, deeply, and with intention. This kind of life doesnâ€™t avoid questions, risk, or vulnerability. This kind of life is the one I want.

If an individual never steps outside of his or her comfort zone, the person will never grow and develop

1.  In the fantasy of an easy life.

Life is tough, but you are tougher.  Pain makes you stronger.  Facing fear makes you braver.  Mistakes and heartbreak make you wiser.   Sometimes things have to go very wrong before they can be right.  Sometimes you have to go through the worst, to arrive at your best.

Your journey isn’t supposed to be easy, it’s supposed to be worth it.  To never struggle is to never grow.  It doesn’t matter what’s happened or what you’ve done; what matters is what you choose to do from here.  Accept the circumstances, learn from them, and move on.  Letting go is often a step forward.  Sometimes you have to walk away from what you thought you wanted to find what you truly need and deserve.


6.) It Doesn¿t Get Easier, It Just Sucks Less

The longer you immerse yourself in the suck, the less it sucks. You get stronger, build a greater aerobic capacity, and become mentally tough. All of these aspects, combined with experience, allow you to know when to push yourself and when to back off, so that you can attack each workout to the best of your ability. Soon, you¿ll come to love the beatdowns. Much like Kevin Bacon in Animal House, you¿ll be screaming, ¿Thank you sir! May I have another?¿ Well, maybe not. But you get the point.

Whatever you do, aim to stretch the metaphorical mental rubber band more and more every day because without pushing yourself, there is no growth, no learning, and no improvement.


If you want to nail a lofty goal, you have to put yourself in an uncomfortable place. ItÕs in that dark, uncomfortable place that true change and transformation happens. ItÕs there that you build the physical and mental grit to meetÑeven exceedÑyour biggest personal challenges.
