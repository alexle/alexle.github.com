Not Enough Time
02-02-2014


 hung up and wondered if she¿d ever heard about the perfect being the enemy of the good. While striving for excellence seems laudable at first glance, it doesn¿t always pay off as you expect and it isn¿t always a goal worth pursuing.

You only have so much time and energy. An A+ effort in one aspect of your live means performance elsewhere necessarily suffers. Those hours spent working your way to the top of the food chain at the office are ones you aren¿t spending on a hobby or with friends, for example. Some people are okay with being an A+ at one thing and a C at several others, but for chronic overachievers, the thought of falling short in any area is unacceptable, which means constant striving for all-around excellence that eventually leads to burnout. There are times when putting in an A+ effort is table stakes, as anyone gunning for a medal at next month¿s Winter Olympics would tell you. But most of us aren¿t Olympians staring down a once-in-a-career opportunity. Instead, we¿re trying to achieve some degree of harmony in our lives between our various responsibilities, needs, desires and obligations. Occasionally, something needs to slip. As aren¿t without a price tag and, sometimes, a B+ is more than good enough.




This is the day for reflection. We stand on the threshold of new opportunities. Are you pleased with the way you invested your time and energies last year? Are there changes you need to make in your lifestyle as we move into 2018? Do you need to drop some activities and add others? Family, church, vocation, and neighbors are all important.

The key word is Òbalance.Ó The greatest satisfaction in life is investing in the lives of others. But you also need to take care of yourself. Proper food, sleep, and recreation keep the body strong. If you are the busy type, establish a daily quiet time to energize your spirit. When you set aside time to renew yourself, youÕll have the energy to love others well. Below, IÕve included some suggestions to do just that.

Could a minor change in your lifestyle make a major difference in your effectiveness?

I challenge you to make the most of the year. Take time for reflection. Make necessary changes. Find balance. Take care of yourself



ÒI donÕt have enough time.Ó WeÕve all said it before.

One of the biggest frustrations many of us feel is having too much to do, and not feeling like we have enough time to do it. We are overwhelmed.

If you keep running out of time, itÕs typically because you are spreading yourself too thin.

Time is the most valuable coin in your life. You and you alone will determine how that coin will be spent. Be careful that you do not let other people spend it for you,Ó says Carl Sandburg.

When people see their time in terms of money, they often grow stingy with the former to maximise the latter.





As I was sitting at work over the last few weeks, days and hours ¿ I couldn¿t help but have a different perspective of defining the purpose of why I am there and what I can do to maximize the 24 hours in a day.  4 words came to mind ¿ Just Go For It.  When it comes to blogging and building our Dividend Diplomat Brand, the same topic of Just Go For It, comes to mind.  Then, when I went on a run and deep in a workout the other day, low and behold ¿ Just Go For It, again, popped in my head.  Run hard and run fast, keep going.  When I am talking to my sister on helping her figure out her career and interviews ¿ Just Go For It, all day.  We are spending time together, to show her guidance on how to prepare, question & answer scenarios, amidst other things, tackling it with everything we have.  Why not, right?  With investing, saving and experiencing life ¿ we have to ¿Just Go For It¿ in each and every way, within each and every day.  Why the heck not?  Find out more with what I¿m talking about, what it means and what can happen if you do. What I am trying to say, boils down to one line.  Just go for it, in everything that you do in your life that makes you happy and is the right thing to do, you have nothing left to lose with only one life to live!  I want everyone to achieve their utmost happiness, have the most time and be able to look back to say they¿ve helped many people and wouldn¿t change a single minute.

I know at times it may be hard to, ¿Just go for it¿, but write down what makes you happy.  Are you currently doing those things?  If not ¿ why not?  Are you able to shift your time/energy/focus from something that doesn¿t make you happy to something that does?  Are you able to work your A$$ off to make that happen?  I know I¿m big on fighting for everything, but we shall not let our foot off the pedal.  So many things will come your way and in the end, ¿it¿s just life!¿  We need to make the most of it while we are here.  I hope that by doing this and having this mindset ¿ you¿ll have no more ¿what-ifs¿ or you won¿t wonder if you pushed ¿just a little bit further¿ at work or on your project, blog or product.  LET¿S GO BABY!!  So stop reading this article, get up and JUST GO FOR IT!








How many times have you started your day with the plan of getting everything done on your to-do list, only to find yourself distracted and with an even longer list at the end of the day? No matter how great our intentions are, it can be difficult to increase our productivity if we aren¿t deliberate about how we manage our time. That said, we can increase output in two ways: put in more hours, or work smarter. I know which one I¿d choose.





The rule of life is: You can have two ÒBig ThingsÓ in your life, but not three.

Big Things include:

Job
Kids
Spouse
Social Life
Major Hobby   (e.g. build a boat in the garage, become a chess master, video game addiction)
Startup
You can do a startup on the side while you have a day job, but your family will never see you. You might even lose your family. It happens. This is partly why itÕs easier to start a company before you have a family or even a spouse.

You can have a job and a social life, but unless your spouse is fully integrated and agreeable to that social life, there will be strife. ÒGoing out with the guys again?Ó

Yes, ÒkidsÓ and ÒspouseÓ are on the list separately. Young kids strain marriages because thereÕs not enough time to invest in the kids as well as be there for each other.


If you are similar to me, you want to create a life that will help you achieve those dreams.

To do that, you need to learn how to master your time, use it in the most efficient way that will help you get results.

The first step is to discover how to use those first hours of your morning because they set the tone for the entire day.

ThatÕs why itÕs important to crush the beginning of the day because it will reflect on rest of it.

The morning routine is nothing more than several habits.


Log every activity for the day. I did this and I found that my most blatant waste of time were the 4 to 5 hours after 5pm everyday. For example:

Dinner Ð (5pm) Ð 30 minutes

Watching Youtube videos Ñ 1 hour
Browsing the web Ñ 1 hour
Using social media Ð 1 hour
Playing video games (or game apps) Ñ 1 hour
Wasting time chatting at the gym when I should be working out Ñ 30 minutes
Those are exaggerated estimates but you get the point. On a typical weekday, we have hours of time we waste.

YouÕll be surprised to discover that you probably have 3-6 hours of things you could easily do less of. AND EVEN MORE ON A WEEKEND!

Imagine your dream life 3 years from now. Figure out what activities wonÕt get you there. Figure out which will.

Smalltalk conversation wonÕt get you there. Watching Youtube wonÕt get you there.

But doing the right task will.



The older I get the more I realize how valuable time is. There¿s only 24 hours in a day, and to make the most of that time, we have to make quick decisions, we have to do what we love, and we have to stop complaining if we are not willing to make a change. To use your time wisely ask yourself, ¿Am I doing anything right now that is amounting to my life goals?¿ If not, ask yourself, ¿What can I be doing right now to help myself succeed?¿

Like there’s not enough time to accomplish everything you need to? Jennifer Tuma-Young has been there. “I was always running and finding ways to fit more and more in, but I was never fulfilled. It was like I was on a wheel,” she recalls. That’s when she decided to become more proactive – and selective – about how she spent her time. “What if we really looked at our time and decided, ‘How do I want to live? What do I want in my life?’” She calls it a ‘day dump,’ in which she and her coaching clients would write down how they’re spending their time, and engage in conscious ‘day design.’ “That level of awareness allows you to make different choices,” she says.

The first step in creating the kind of schedule you want, says Tuma-Young, author of Balance Your Life, Balance the Scale, is understanding your “anchoring system” or core values. She uses the acronym BALANCE to represent it, and encourages clients to “Brain dump and breathe; Assess and accept; Let go and laugh; Add and appreciate; Navigate and find joy in the journey; Confront and connect so you can get to the root issues; and Engage and experience the gift of life.”

 “I always said ‘I never have enough time,’ but I was just making myself busy, like going to every networking event with the possibility of meeting someone. [I had to realize] not everything is meant for me; the world seems to be a smorgasbord, but it’s not.” She tries to live out the same values in parenting her young children. “Many kids are in every activity you can imagine, but my kids pick one activity and commit to it fully. If they don’t like it, the next season they can pick another, but they’re not doing more than one in a season because I want them to understand the concept of choice.” 

 Saying no can be difficult in a go-go society. “It’s making peace with the fear of missing out,” she says. Sometimes that means putting your foot down and setting expectations at work. “I’ve realized the beauty of paring back and have worked with executives to put their Blackberries down and not expect their employees to respond at 9:30 at night.
