Millions of people are convinced that something must change in their lives to be better, to live life to the fullest or pursue something meaningful.

That project, that blog, that podcast, that ebook, that art, that side project is what IÕm talking about.

Many people consistently hold back, and waste precious time.


Instead of the excitement of experimentation, many people feel self-doubt and fear. They just go through life. Just like that.

Passing through. Letting time tick away. Fast.

Letting things happen.

Letting every day be just like the day before and the day after.

Nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing you read about in history books.

Nothing unique. Just average.

Despite the many inspirational content encouraging us to chase after what we believe, we often fall victim to procrastination and a fear of even just starting.

We inadvertently hurt ourselves by focusing on short-term pleasure at the cost of the long-term.



In his letter to shareholders back in 2016, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gave the best advice I¿ve ever heard on how to stop procrastinating:

¿Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you¿re probably being slow. Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you¿re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.¿
What Bezos is saying is that you should think like a C student. When you¿re about 70% sure, you take a guess and see what happens.

Unlike on a test, you can course correct later. If you realize two weeks into a new marketing campaign that it¿s not going to work, you drop it and start over. If you realize three months into a new job that you don¿t like it, you can look for another one.

In nearly all cases, that¿s cheaper than spending months deliberating over whether it¿s the perfect campaign or perfect job.





"The best way (to generate ideas) is to write down all your frustrations all day long," Vienna said. "I don't like sitting in traffic. My phone died. Those are problems that need solved."







The thing is, we don¿t feel fit enough. This is as ridiculous as waiting to start a diet until we feel thinner. The point is, we¿re never ready. Showing up is breaking the seal on uncertainty and procrastination, popping the membrane between ¿someday¿ and ¿making it happen.¿ Showing up is waking up to potential and possibilities. Showing up is a starting line. Showing up takes balls. Showing up is honoring the ¿try.¿ Showing up is step one to being all in. Showing up creates momentum, and momentum drives a wheel out of its rut.


Showing up is the physical manifestation of writing down a goal: it¿s stating an intention with the presence of your body. It doesn¿t mean you are ready, it means you are willing. Showing up is the process that yields the outcome. Showing up means you respect yourself enough to stop thinking or talking about something and just do the damn thing. It is transformative. It is courageous. It is liberating. It breaks the pull of the past and roots you solidly in the present.

Showing up shushes doubt and gives fear the finger.

Showing up consistently for others speaks a language of love, because you can be counted on.



 I would not wait for an Ideal Job. The only ideal job I ever heard of was the one some other fellow had.

It is quite important to find the best thing to do. It is much more important to find something to do. If I were a young artist, I would paint soap advertisements, if that were all opportunity offered, until I got ahead enough to indulge in the painting of madonnas and landscapes. If I were a young musician, I would rather play in a street band than not at all. If I were a young writer, I would do hack work, if necessary, until I became able to write the Great American Novel.

I would go to work. Nothing in all this world I have found is so good as work.







One day I complained to someone close to me, who gave me the gift of a question: ÒThen why donÕt you quit your job and do what you want instead?Ó I know the option of quitting seems obvious. It had occurred to me many times. But that was the first time I heard the Òthen why donÕt youÓ part.

Why hadnÕt I quit? Because IÕd wrapped myself in a thicket of Òhave toÕs.Ó I have to have a steady income. I have to have the respect that comes with a business card from a leading-edge company. I have to, not I want to. Assumptions, beliefs, and habits, not wrong but also not laws of nature that I have to obey.

When I noticed the self-imposed have toÕs I could question their influence on my decision. I quit my job the next day. I wanted to live my dreams.




The truth is, the right thing to do and the easy thing to do are rarely the same thing.  You have to push yourself.  You have to be willing to fail forward.  Because if you try something and fail, you’ve learned a lesson, you’ve got some priceless practice, and next time you’ll be one step ahead.  But if you don’t even try, out of empty fear, you have learned nothing, and you’ll likely continue procrastinating because you’re stuck in the habit of running from fear.  And this running is just as exhausting as actually pushing through and doing it anyway.

Remember, there’s a big difference between empty fatigue and gratifying exhaustion.  Life is short.  Invest in activities that move you forward.  The value of doing is so much greater than the value of being safe and doing nothing for the rest of your life.

Listen up, creators: Don¿t wait until that thing you¿re making is ¿perfect¿ or absolutely finished. Ship version 1.0 when it¿s good enough but you might even be embarrassed by it.

The quote above comes from Matt Mullenweg, founding developer of WordPress. He describes how trying to fit in just ¿one more thing¿ can be detrimental to your project:


What killed us was ¿one more thing.¿ We could have easily done three major releases that year if we had drawn a line in the sand, said ¿finished,¿ and shipped the darn thing. The problem is that the longer it¿s been since your last release the more pressure and anticipation there is, so you¿re more likely to try to slip in just one more thing or a fix that will make a feature really shine. For some projects, this literally goes on forever.


[...]I imagine prior to the launch of the iPod, or the iPhone, there were teams saying the same thing: the copy + paste guys are *so close* to being ready and we know Walt Mossberg is going to ding us for this so let¿s just not ship to the manufacturers in China for just a few more weeks¿ The Apple teams were probably embarrassed. But if you¿re not embarrassed when you ship your first version you waited too long.


Shipping early and often, he continues, gives you the critical feedback from users that¿s needed to improve your work:

8. Choose your truth over society's demands.

The easiest way to feel unhappy and frustrated with life is to play by life’s rules, follow and do what everyone else is doing—just because they're doing it.

As years go by, the more you conform and blindly follow society’s lead, the more miserable you’ll be.

Choose to live your truth; follow your heart’s lead, bow out of unwanted obligations and live the life you desire. Ignore cultural noise, or demands for you to conform.

9. Choose to take achievable daily actions rather than make grandiose bucket lists.

Bucket lists are where dreams go to die. You may put your most-wanted dreams on your bucket list, but don’t put off your happiness till some future experience is realized.

Pick a few small things you really want to change or do and start taking the steps toward making that happen today. Save up for that trip, start on that passion project, write that book. By the time you’re ready to dive into your bucket list, you might not be here!

Working on your most treasured dreams today is maybe the best way I know to be happier immediately, and every day.




You can never fully anticipate how an audience is going to react to something you¿ve created until it¿s out there. That means every moment you¿re working on something without it being in the public it¿s actually dying, deprived of the oxygen of the real world.


Remember that done is better than perfect, so fuck it, ship it.

¿You don¿t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.¿ ¿ Zig Ziglar

The Physics of Real Life

As Sir Isaac Newton taught us a long time ago, objects at rest tend to stay at rest and objects in motion tend to stay in motion. This is just as true for humans as it is for falling apples.

The 2-Minute Rule works for big goals as well as small goals because of the inertia of life. Once you start doing something, it's easier to continue doing it. I love the 2-Minute Rule because it embraces the idea that all sorts of good things happen once you get started.

Want to become a better writer? Just write one sentence (2-Minute Rule), and you'll often find yourself writing for an hour.

Want to eat healthier? Just eat one piece of fruit (2-Minute Rule), and you'll often find yourself inspired to make a healthy salad as well.

Want to make reading a habit? Just read the first page of a new book (2-Minute Rule), and before you know it, the first three chapters have flown by.

Want to run three times a week? Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, just get your running shoes on and get out the door (2-Minute Rule), and you'll end up putting mileage on your legs instead of popcorn in your stomach.

The most important part of any new habit is getting started ¿ not just the first time, but each time. It's not about performance, it's about consistently taking action. In many ways, getting started is more important than succeeding. This is especially true in the beginning because there will be plenty of time to improve your performance later on.


Try It Now

I can't guarantee whether or not the 2-Minute Rule will work for you. But, I can guarantee that it will never work if you never try it.

The problem with most articles you read, podcasts you listen to, or videos you watch is that you consume the information but never put it into practice.

I want this article to be different. I want you to actually use this information, right now.

What's something you can do that will take you less than two minutes? Do it right now.

Anyone can spare the next 120 seconds. Use this time to get one thing done. Go.

1. Share New Ideas and Skills¿Even If You Aren¿t Quite Ready

Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, said something once that will probably live in startup infamy forevermore:


If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you¿ve launched too late.


This ¿start before you¿re ready¿ attitude isn¿t just for startups: It¿s good advice for anyone trying something new.




You talk too much. I will straight up quit mentoring someone if they talk about their goals too much without ever getting anywhere. It¿s my biggest pet peeve, to hear someone whine and wail about an issue or an achievement they hope to get, yet have no action plan and literally have the momentum of a turtle. Are you kidding? You¿re wasting my time, but you¿re definitely wasting your life. 

Talking about goals and never doing it is torture for everyone around you and a death sentence for your future. ¿Oh I¿m totally going to start a blog one day,¿ or ¿I¿m gonna start working out,¿ or ¿I need to find a new job¿ ¿ these statements have zero action attached to them and you¿re literally daydreaming out loud. Worse, you¿re crying wolf and no one around you will believe you the next time you say it. 

Biggest sign of this issue is pre-announcing your goal. If you¿re doing something for social validation (which this is), then you¿re kinda already losing. Check your motivation and make sure you actually want to do this and then quit talking about it. Do it already. Then lock down your humble brag afterwards if you must. 


ÒIÕve been putting this off for way too long; itÕs long past time for me to start the business IÕve been dreaming about. IÕll start slow as a side project for now and see where it takes me. Today IÕm going to make things happen.Ó


9. DO IT A LOT.

What you do every day matters much more than what you do once in awhile.

I had a friend who wanted to get better at painting. But she thought she had to be in Paris, with all the conditions right.

She never made it to Paris. Now she sits in a cubicle under fluorescent lights, filling out paperwork all day.

Write every day, network every day, play every day, live healthy every day.

Measure your life in the number of times you do things. When you die: are you 2 writing sessions old? Or are you 50,0000?

Success never comes to look for you while you wait around thinking about it.

You are what you do, not what you say youÕll do.  Knowledge is basically useless without action.  Good things donÕt come to those who wait; they come to those who work on meaningful goals.  Ask yourself whatÕs really important and then have the courage to build your life around your answer.

And remember, if you wait until you feel 100% ready to begin, youÕll likely be waiting the rest of your life.




I used to create a draft in Tumblr every time I had an idea for a blog post. Then I'd let it sit there for a while, because I believed the idea wasn't fully formed yet, or I didn't have enough points to share about the topic. I believed that by delaying, the perfect post would eventually come to mind.

What I've realized is that there is no better time to write than when the thought first enters your mind. I should only write it at another time if I simply can't open my laptop and write it all the way through right at that moment. The content is freshest when it first appears in my mind, and in that state I write the best posts.

I've gotten much better at this over time, but I have 10s of drafts lying in Tumblr from the early days when this caught me time and time again. If you delay, the likely outcome is that it just won't get written.


Over time, the concept of "shipping" started to really fascinate me. I forced myself to, despite it being uncomfortable, "ship" everything I did earlier and earlier. Whether a product, a blog post, a speaking opportunity, I'd quit delaying and just put it out there or say "yes" to speaking.

One of my biggest learnings in the last year is that there is immense power in doing a huge volume of work. If I write a blog post every week, I learn a massive amount about what works, and it gives me much more inspiration for more articles. Also, if I write each week, I'm gradually reaching more people, growing my connections on Twitter and Facebook, and putting myself in a better position overall. I know now that if I don't publish one week, I'm missing out on these benefits. Therefore, I actually fear not shipping.

Fear of failure keeps us stagnant. We're afraid to jump for our dreams because we might not make it. We think that not making it would be an end to those dreams. One day, when we're ready, we'll try for real. One day¿ But the only day that matters is today. Most of us know that tomorrow rarely comes. Don't let fear of failure hold you back from giving it your all. Put it down on paper, so to speak. If it doesn't work, get another sheet and try again.
For some, this may involve making a hundred sketches to find the right design, or writing a dozen drafts before you find the one that works. It can apply to anything, though. If you want to be more sociable, start by talking to people. You won't learn what works until you try. And failure is just one step on that road.




Ship Often and Early

In the end, satisficing is all about execution. It emphasizes making smart decisions that allow you to create faster. So, as you execute, it’s important that you ship the results out into the world, rather than sit on them until you’re sure they’re perfect. Think of it as a beta test through which you gather valuable real-world feedbackbefore moving on. For example, say you were asked to develop a new reporting format for your sales department. The satisficing approach would be to develop the format, then send it to your team for review and feedback before you spend weeks building a complex algorithm that no one ends up needing anyway.


Where have I heard this before?

Stop theorizing.
Write lots of software.
Learn from your mistakes.
Quantity always trumps quality. Thatâ€™s why the one bit of advice I always give aspiring bloggers is to pick a schedule and stick with it. Itâ€™s the only advice that matters, because until youâ€™ve mentally committed to doing it over and over, you will not improve. You canâ€™t.

When it comes to software, the same rule applies. If you arenâ€™t building, you arenâ€™t learning. Rather than agonizing over whether youâ€™re building the right thing, just build it. And if that one doesnâ€™t work, keep building until you get one that does.

Iâ€™ve been unhappy with every single piece of software Iâ€™ve ever released. Partly because, like many software developers, Iâ€™m a perfectionist. And then, there are inevitably Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ problems:

The schedule was too aggressive and too short. We need more time!
We ran into unforeseen technical problems that forced us to make compromises we are uncomfortable with.
We had the wrong design, and needed to change it in the middle of development.
Our team experienced internal friction between team members that we didnâ€™t anticipate.
The customers werenâ€™t who we thought they were.
Communication between the designers, developers, and project team wasnâ€™t as efficient as we thought it would be.
We overestimated how quickly we could learn a new technology.
The list goes on and on. Reasons for failure on a software project are legion.

At the end of the development cycle, you end up with software that is a pale shadow of the shining, glorious monument to software engineering that you envisioned when you started.

Itâ€™s tempting, at this point, to throw in the towel â€” to add more time to the schedule so you can get it right before shipping your software. Because, after all, real developers ship.

Iâ€™m here to tell you that this is a mistake.

Yes, you did a ton of things wrong on this project. But you also did a ton of things wrong that you donâ€™t know about yet. And thereâ€™s no other way to find out what those things are until you ship this version and get it in front of users and customers. I think Donald Rumsfeld put it best:

As we know, There are known knowns. There are things we know we know. We also know There are known unknowns. That is to say We know there are some things We do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns,
The ones we donâ€™t know
We donâ€™t know.
In the face of the inevitable end-of-project blues â€” rife with compromises and totally unsatisfying quick fixes and partial soutions â€” you could hunker down and lick your wounds. You could regroup and spend a few extra months fixing up this version before releasing it. You might even feel good about yourself for making the hard call to get the engineering right before unleashing yet another buggy, incomplete chunk of software on the world.

Unfortunately, this is an even bigger mistake than shipping a flawed version.

Instead of spending three months fixing up this version in a sterile, isolated lab, you could be spending that same three month period listening to feedback from real live, honest-to-god, annoyingdedicated users of your software. Not the software as you imagined it, and the users as you imagined them, but as they exist in the real world. You can turn around and use that directed, real world feedback to not only fix all the sucky parts of version 1, but spend your whole development budget more efficiently, predicated on hard usage data from your users.

Now, Iâ€™m not saying you should release crap. Believe me, weâ€™re all perfectionists here. But the real world can be a cruel, unforgiving place for us perfectionists. Itâ€™s saner to let go and realize that when your software crashes on the rocky shore of the real world, disappointment is inevitable Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ but fixable! Whatâ€™s important isnâ€™t so much the initial state of the software â€” in fact, some say if you arenâ€™t embarrassed by v1.0 you didnâ€™t release it early enough â€” but what you do after releasing the software.

The velocity and responsiveness of your team to user feedback will set the tone for your software, far more than any single release ever could. Thatâ€™s what you need to get good at. Not the platonic ideal of shipping mythical, perfect software, but being responsive to your users, to your customers, and demonstrating that through the act of continually improving and refining your software based on their feedback. So to the extent that youâ€™re optimizing for near-perfect software releases, youâ€™re optimizing for the wrong thing.

Thereâ€™s no question that, for whatever time budget you have, you will end up with better software by releasing as early as practically possible, and then spending the rest of your time iterating rapidly based on real world feedback.

So trust me on this one: even if version 1 sucks, ship it anyway.


Many people, after accruing a reasonable amount of experience, often wait out perfection. We think we're not ready yet, or that we need more time before our skill level or work proficiency can take us somewhere. At those times, when we fail to act because we know we'll fail, mistakes might just provide the solution. Next time you feel yourself stuck, consider screwing up on purpose. You might not get what you really want, but you'll probably learn something that'll bring you a little closer to your goal.

So itâ€™s easier to hesitate, to wait for the perfect moment, to decide we need to think a bit longer or do some more research or explore a few more unnecessary alternatives.

Meanwhile days, weeks, months, and even years of our precious lives pass us by.  And so do our dreams.
