What is beginner's mind? It's dropping our expectations and preconceived ideas about something, and seeing things with an open mind, fresh eyes, just like a beginner. If you've ever learned something new, you can remember what that's like: you're probably confused, because you don't know how to do whatever you're learning, but you're also looking at everything as if it's brand new, perhaps with curiosity and wonder. That's beginner's mind.

But imagine if you could apply this to every activity. Take eating breakfast, for example:

You start by seeing the activity of eating with fresh eyes, as if you don't know what to expect, as if you hadn't done it thousands of times already.
You really look at the food, the bowl, the spoon, and try to see the details that you might not normally notice.
You truly notice the textures, tastes, smells, sights of the food, pay close attention as if you don't already know how the food will taste. Everything seems new, perhaps even full of wonder.
You don't take anything for granted, and appreciate every bite as a gift. It's temporary, fleeting, and precious.
As you can see, this practice of beginner's mind transforms the activity.

Why it matters

When you practice beginner's mind with an activity:

Better experiences: You aren't clouded by prejudgments, preconceptions, fantasies about what it should be or assumptions about how you already know it will be. When you don't have these, you can't be disappointed or frustrated by the experience, because there's no fantasy or preconception to compare it to.
Better relationships: If you are talking to someone else, instead of being frustrated by them because they aren't meeting your ideal, you can see them with fresh eyes and notice that they're just trying to be happy, that they have good intentions (even if they're not your intentions), and they are struggling just like you are. This transforms your relationship with the person.
Less procrastination: If you're procrastinating on a big work task, you could look at it with beginner's mind and instead of worrying about how hard the task will be or how you might fail at it … you can be curious about what the task will be like. You can notice the details of doing the task, instead of trying to get away from them.
Less anxiety: If you have an upcoming event or meeting that you're anxious about … instead of worrying about what might happen, you can open yourself up to being curious about what will happen, let go of your preconceived ideas about the outcome and instead embrace not knowing, embrace being present and finding gratitude in the moment for what you're doing and who you're meeting.
As you can see, the practice of beginner's mind can transform any activity, get rid of a lot of our difficulties, allow us to be more flexible, open, curious, grateful, present.
