Happiness
02-14-2012



What do you mean when you say happiness is a choice?

You come to understand that the quality of our lives isnøt based in the events of our lives. Itøs really in the reaction to the events in our lives. Thatøs a really useful thing, to realize øI donøt have control over some of the events in my life, like the weather, but I actively have a say in how I respond to the weather.ø The title of the book is Happiness Is a Choice You Make, but the key word isnøt happiness. Itøs choice. Itøs declaring that you wonøt be defined or determined by the circumstances of your life. You have a say in this. That declaration is liberating. That liberation is happiness. Happiness isnøt just the thing you choose; itøs the act of choosing it that makes you happy.






There’s always something, any time you look. Any interesting sensory experience or pleasant feeling will do: the warmth of a space heater, the cat on your lap, the play of sunlight on the table.

That’s the other important part: we don’t need to reserve our gratitude for the big, lifetime-scale conditions, such as health, economic class, or loved ones. In every moment, regardless of your problems, your experience is being improved and beautified by all sorts of small, often haphazard pleasures: the color of the sky, the embrace of this sweater, the protective shelter of this building, the peacefulness of this neighborhood, the taste of this coffee, the softness of this chair, the chirping of these birds, the alertness of your mind right now.

Cultivating gratitude this way creates a completely different relationship to the good in your life than simply revisiting in your mind the logical reasons you ought to feel grateful. You’ll appreciate so much more of every day, even bad days, when you look for the small pleasures of present moment experience instead.

As I pour my coffee, steam billows out into the sunlight, creating a luminous, three-dimensional plume that would please anybody, as long as they were paying attention. When we seek our gratitude only by thinking and remembering, something as obscure as the beauty of sunlight passing through steam would never occur to us.

For me, at this moment, it’s wonderful that I have this warm drink. This hoodie feels great on my shoulders. This laptop is so quick; it doesn’t lag like the old one. The sky is pale and picturesque. My houseplants are doing well. This chair is comfortable. My neighbor is singing downstairs. I’m enjoying all of these details despite every unresolved big-picture problem I have.

My list of tiny pleasures might not sound so thrilling to you, and that’s fine. Again, it doesn’t matter how it feels to think about it. This practice creates many private experiences of gratitude you couldn’t easily explain to another person. I love the little triangle of sun in the corner of the table, how it’s almost equilateral by chance. I love the youthful green stem of my geranium, and its fuzz of infinitesimal white hairs. The pleasure of these sights is already mine; I don’t need to convince myself that they constitute a good reason to be grateful, and certainly no one else needs to understand.

Those pleasant little details may be small, but they’re not insignificant. They contribute to your well-being, and well-being is all that matters ultimately. Every moment contains so many pleasant, helpful or beautiful details, most of which we didn’t earn, aren’t entitled to, and may not be there next time we look. The shine of this bank’s polished floor. The solidity of this vehicle. The way the last of the water disappears down the sink.

Then, when you bring this same grateful awareness to the truly consequential conditions of your life—this steaming dinner in front of you, the warmth and safety of this kitchen, the presence of your loved ones around this very table, right in this moment—the heart overflows with thankfulness.






Achievement
Everyone wants to be happy. There’s a ton of self-help books out there, all dedicated to finding happiness.

The thing is, happiness is an ephemeral thing. It tends to come and go. Perhaps it’s Friday night, after a long work week, and you’re out on the town with friends.

You hit the pub, hoist a few beers, sing a few songs, and for a little bit you feel happy. It’s good to balance out the stressors of life with some enjoyable diversions. It’s just that the joy doesn’t last very long.

There is, however, one strategy that extends your happiness. In fact, it can generate a kind of baseline happiness that always stays with you. What is that strategy? Personal achievement.

I’m happiest when I paint a nice landscape, or illustrate an article that reflects my best thinking and creative effort. It’s the kind of happiness that stays with me. I feel good about myself.

Focus on achievement in your life. Work on improving yourself, your work and your creative passions. When you invest in yourself and reach new heights, it’s immensely gratifying. And it brings lasting happiness.




Happiness is letting go of what you assume your life is supposed to be like right now,
and sincerely appreciating it for everything that it is. So, RELAX. You are enough. You have enough. You do enough. Breathe deep... let go, and just live right now in this moment - marcandangel


So I was gratified (happy?) when a colleague sent me an article from the Greater Good Science Center that was titled “Is a Happy Life Different from a Meaningful One?” Written by Jill Suttie and Jason Marsh, it begins by differentiating the interrelated definitions of meaningfulness and happiness, which are often seen as equivalent. I find it easier to relate to meaningfulness, which seems less ephemeral, more robust and more substantial than happiness.

The article compares the two concepts and shows that satisfying your needs and wants is not really relevant to a meaningful life. Indeed, we all are able to put immediate needs aside for a bit when something is meaningful, like when we forget to eat or sleep while working on an important project. Meaningfulness is future-looking, while happiness is here-and-now. Meaningfulness is found in giving, while happiness is too often focused on taking. And, unlike happiness, meaningfulness can be stressful and challenging.

Expectations:

But I only consider outcomes once they happen rather than writing a script in my mind that I react to after the fact.

I wasnøt always this way. I used to set up expectations in my head all day long. Constantly measuring reality against an imagined reality is taxing and tiring. I think it often wrings the joy out of just experiencing something for what it is. So over the past few years Iøve let those go and ended up considerably happier and more content.

And really, every day has a shot at being pretty great when your only expectation is that the sun comes up.

When I go to a movie I donøt expect it to be bad, good, or greatøøøI just want to go see the movie. After itøs over I can ask myself if I liked it or not, not how it measured up to how much I thought Iød like it (or not). Iøm convinced that people would like things a whole lot more if someone else didnøt tell them they wouldnøt like it. Stufføs pretty great, you know.


2. Avoid the ødonøtsø
Your language makes a huge difference in your attitudes and your behavior, Wittman writes. Try to omit the word ødonøtø from your speech and your thoughts, so that youøre less focused on the potential negative outcome and more focused on the positive.

For example, instead of, øDonøt lose,ø youød say, øLetøs win.ø And instead of, øDonøt be afraid,ø youød say, øBe courageous.ø

most people are upset because their expectations aren't met, you expect other people to be a certain way, you expect yourself to be a certain way, you expect life should be a certain way and it isn't, trade your expectations for appreciation, appreciate this moment, appreciate things around you
One cannot be dashed to the earth unless lifted first.



Happiness = reality - expectations


Because a wedding isn't about the perfect dress or the combination of flowers; that is simply the production side. A wedding is about this: The billions of people on this planet, and for whatever reason, you and your significant other were in the same place at the same time and met. Think of all of the things that could've prevented that meeting. All of those things that didn't happen because you were meant to meet and be married. Think of all of those moments where you questioned why certain things were happening in your life and now you look back and see that they all lead you to each other. Think of the moment you knew and that feeling you had when your mind and your heart said, "this is the one".

Think of those moments when you can't find the perfect linen, when your guests complain about where they are sitting, and when you feel the pressure creeping up on your to make this the most important day of your life. It is a moment in time, a short moment created by all of those other important moments. When you look at your wedding as not the "best day ever" but as "the best is yet to come," you will free yourself from the pressure of everything having to be perfect, and instead you will realize one thing: it already is. Because you found each other.



I’m sometimes grumpier when I stay at a nice hotel. I have certain expectations about the service that’s going to be provided. I get impatient if I have to crawl around looking for a power outlet, if the shower controls are unfathomable, if the place considers itself too fancy to put a coffee machine in each room. I’m sometimes happier at a budget motel, where my expectations are lower, and where a functioning iron is a bonus and the waffle maker in the breakfast area is a treat.

This little phenomenon shows how powerfully expectations structure our moods and emotions, none more so than the beautiful emotion of gratitude.

Most people feel grateful some of the time — after someone saves you from a mistake or brings you food during an illness. But some people seem grateful dispositionally. They seem thankful practically all of the time.

These people may have big ambitions, but they have preserved small anticipations. As most people get on in life and earn more status, they often get used to more respect and nicer treatment. But people with dispositional gratitude take nothing for granted. They take a beginner’s thrill at a word of praise, at another’s good performance or at each sunny day. These people are present-minded and hyperresponsive.




“Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things.” ~Robert Brault


You should stop searching for happiness, because that’s not really what you want. We don’t plan our lives around elevated emotional states. What we want are worthwhile lives, and if we have to make sacrifices for that, then so much the worse for ‘happiness’.




Be curious.

That's right. Happiness is not about chasing after the things "successful" people do or have, and it's not about constant indulgence. Happiness is not about getting a therapist or hiring help (though doing those things could be a great next step to unleashing your curiosity).



I just wanted to point out that I’m extremely lucky to be in my current position and I really have nothing to complain about. I have a loving family, I’m financially secure and I have a lot of good things going for me right now.


5. You're passionate about your job, your hobbies, and your life.

After all, what is there to enjoy if we don't enjoy life? You know you've done well in life when you love your job, have hobbies that you enjoy doing, and just love waking up everyday. You feel excited about what the day will bring and whom you will meet. Isn't life just wonderful?


I genuinely love that profound realisation that I have the capability, tools and resources to help someone. It is the Good morning, the friendly smile, the holding of the door for someone else. It is giving compliments. It is highlighting otherøs strengths, not weaknesses. It is encouraging people to be themselves. It is giving up time to help those in need.

You were born with the ability to change someone’s life. – Don’t ever waste it.  Be kind.  Be present.  Be someone who makes a difference.  In a gentle way, you can shake the world.  Truth be told, the purpose of life is not just to be happy in your own little bubble; it is to be helpful, to be honorable, to be compassionate and kind, to have your life make some kind of difference that you have lived and lived well.  Go ahead; leave the world a little better than you found it.

So many of us live in a perpetual state of wanting moreømore money, more shiny new toys, more things. And we chase those material possessions with more gusto than we pursue whatøs been empirically shown to increase happiness: more joy, more experiences, and more time.


We begin to see the true source of joy and happiness ø and it isnøt in the stuff we buy, keep, clean, organize, and maintain. Happiness is found in relationships with other people, pursuing our passions, acquiring experiences. Happiness is found in doing what we love, what matters to us ø the meaningful in our lives. Once we realize stuff does not make us happy, we obtain a new perspective that touches nearly every aspect of our lives.


Alistair Owen pours most of his paycheck into what he calls a travel-and-lifestyle fund.

øIøm not saving up to buy anything,ø said the 28-year-old engineer, who shares a rented apartment with two flatmates in south London. øI prefer to go out for dinner at a nice place, pay a round at the pub or explore a new area of the world. I feel like I would be losing out on living if I chose to own stuff instead.ø


A survey by market-research firm Harris Poll and Eventbrite Inc., an online marketplace for ticket sales, showed 78 percent of millennials would rather pay for an experience than material goods. That compares with 59 percent for baby boomers. Some 82 percent of millennials said they went to a live event in the past year -- concerts and festivals -- and 72 percent said they plan to increase spending on such outings.

øItøs now experiences that people are short on, not items,ø says Oswald, whose research focuses on what he calls the economics of happiness.


A sacrifice for all this fun: savings. With incomes shrinking, only 34 percent of millennials worldwide said they saved enough money each month, according to Nielsenøs 2015 Global Generational Lifestyles survey. Theyøre also not that interested in allocating funds to acquire the totems of their parents. Buying a car was a top priority for only 15 percent of millennials in a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. survey cited in a 2015 report. The number was the same for purchasing a television, and just 10 percent for a luxury bag.

øI donøt put much of my monthly salary aside at all,ø said Mathews, who works on the trading floor at an American investment bank. Itøs bonus time, and sheøs planning trips to the Philippines and Japan. øIød rather rent a really nice room, explore the world, have some fun with my friends and enjoy my life rather than own a bunch of things. Thereøs an element of freedom in that.ø


What gives? Studies [H-3] show rich people arenøt any happier than the rest of us. In fact, many are more stressed and spend less time doing enjoyable activities.

It’s worth pointing out that dealing with depression and anxiety is not necessarily the same thing as boosting happiness. Still, Meng’s first piece of happiness advice appears to have growing scientific credence. 

Step two: “Log moments of joy”

This means simply saying to yourself – as you sip a great espresso, laugh at your friend’s joke or buy that shirt you’ve wanted – “I am having a moment of joy!” When negative things happen to us throughout the day we tend to hold on to them, while the good things are more fleeting and ephemeral. So, by consciously acknowledging the good things, says Meng, we increase our chances that when we reflect on our day, we conclude it was happy one.

The hypothesis that noting positive experiences counterbalances, or outweighs, negatives makes intuitive sense. We can all relate to the power of a single, even short-lived incident tainting a whole day, but rarely does the reverse seem true. As Jonny Mercer sang, you have to “accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative”.

We designed this track to help you appreciate what you have, instead of always looking for more.

1. Happiness isn’t outside of us
We often seek happiness outside of ourselves, through pleasure (food, shopping, video games, TV, Internet, alcohol, cigarettes, drugs) or other people (the person of our dreams, approval of others, social networks) or big life goals (travel, creating a business, art).

But I’ve learned that none of those things actually makes you happy. Sure, they can give you a boost of pleasure or joy, but it’s temporary and soon you’re looking for the next thing that will make you happy. This leaves you in a constant state of seeking pleasure, distraction, approval, comparisons to others, and so on. And it doesn’t result in contentment.

However, if we realize that happiness isn’t outside of us, but actually comes from within … then we can always access it. What is the source of this inner happiness? I find that I can do certain things that make me happy: being grateful for who I am and what I have, learning about myself and the world, playing and being curious, thinking about others and wishing them happiness … these things might be tied to external things (what I have, other people), but they are available no matter where I am, what I have, who is in the world.

And they can help during a tough journey. If you can find happiness inside you, then no matter what’s happening externally, you can access this source of happiness. You might lose your job, get sick, lose a loved one, have to go through a difficult medical procedure, go through a divorce … and you can still find this happiness. It’s there if you choose to use it. The external circumstances of your life matter, but they don’t take away your true source of happiness.


margin of happiness..

Spending 2 years doing something you don't enjoy is a full 3.4% of your life. What are you getting back for that investment? Money? What are you going to do with that money that will be worth the non-refundable 3.4% of your life? An extra room in your house?


At the time, I believed I was doing important work..

As a 38-year-old who has had time in retirement to tweak these factors for at least seven years, Iím already almost ridiculously happy by default. I already have more than enough of most things: travel, luxury, food and beer among them. So it makes sense that spending more money on exactly those things would not increase happiness. And thus, in my situation the extra spending was a ìwasteî in the sense that it did not make me even happier.

But as it turns out, it doesnít take much money to maximize happiness anyway.

Spending money on experiences brings you more lasting happiness than spending money on Stuff. For example, a vacation will make your life better, over time, than a new couch.

It’s okay to think small. Spending on several small treats — like a massage, a good book, or dinner at your favorite restaurant — will bring you more happiness than one big-ticket item like a sports car.

Experiences also pay off better than Stuff because we tend to color our memories happy. Let’s say you spring for that new couch. The day you bring it home, it’s perfect. The exact shade, texture, and firmness you wanted. You’re in your bliss, sitting on it for the first time.



I have more than enough to be happy.
The happiest of people arent the luckiest, and they usually dont have the best of everything either.  They simply make the most of everything they do have.  The reason so many people are unhappy is because they tend to look at whatís missing in their life, instead of whatís present.

Despite the increasing wealth of the society, people are not happier ñ in fact, they have become unhappier.î  Why?  Their unhappiness isnt due to a lack of material wealth, but because they have flawed perceptions of what it takes to be happy.  They think happiness comes from material goods or financial wealth, when these things are simply means to live a better quality life, rather than vehicles of happiness itself.

As adults we somehow grow into the belief that we need everything to be a certain way in order to find and appreciate moments of happiness.  But the truth is, to be happy we need much less than we think we need.  In fact, I believe one of the best feelings comes when you realize that you can be perfectly OK and happy without the things you once thought you needed. 

Life is too short to be wasted, we all know that. Yet, most people live a default life, forcing themselves to think they are happy even though they are not. Why? Because, we let the society dictates how our lives should be lived and what success and happiness should be like. Things like money and prestige are given too much importance to the detriment of focusing on what is really essential to us: living a life in line with our inner values, accomplishing valuable things.
Anticipation accounts for a huge chunk of happiness, which comes from thinking about the events we plan. Vanderkam writes, "As you look forward to something good that is about to happen, you experience some of the same joy you would in the moment. The major difference is that the joy can last much longer."

Happiness Is Not the Same as Pleasure
When most people think they are seeking happiness, they are actually seeking pleasure: good food, more sex, more time for TV and movies, a new car, parties with friends, full body massages, becoming more popular, and so on.

But while pleasure is great, it's not the same as happiness. Pleasure is correlated with happiness, but does not cause it. Someone developing a drug habit, for example, was probably pursuing pleasure but may end up far from happiness. Someone having an affair might hurt their loved ones in pursuit of pleasure. The pursuit of immediate pleasure rarely results in long-term satisfaction.

Research shows that people who focus their energy on materialistic and superficial pleasures end up more anxious, more emotionally unstable and less happy in the long-run. Pleasure is the most shallow form of life satisfaction and therefore the easiest. Pleasure is what's marketed to us. It's what we fixate on. It's what we use to distract ourselves. But pleasure, while necessary, isn't sufficient. There's something more.

Completing a marathon makes us happier than eating a chocolate cake. Raising a child makes us happier than beating a video game. Starting a small business with friends and struggling to make money makes us happier than buying a new computer.

And the funny thing is that all three of the activities above are exceedingly unpleasant and require setting high expectations and potentially failing to always meet them. Yet, they are some of the most meaningful moments and activities of our lives. They involve pain, struggle, even anger and despair, and yet once we've done them we look back and get misty-eyed.


If only [blank], I would be truly happy.

We’ve all uttered that phrase at one point during our lives, right?

Whether we were kids hoping for that one Christmas present we really wanted or adults in search of that next promotion, we’re constantly in pursuit of that one thing that will make us happy.

When we finally get what we’ve spent so much time and effort searching for, we’re finally happy… at first. But you know what happens next. Inevitably, a week or two down the road we’re right back where we started looking for the next thing.

Researchers have a term for this cycle known as hedonic adaptation. We experience some positive change (new car, new toy, pay raise, etc), enjoy a momentary increase in happiness, and finally, find ourselves just as happy (or unhappy) as we were before the whole thing started.

Appreciating a life change slows down adaptation, allowing people to sustain the boost in happiness from that change. It’s impossible to appreciate aspects of your life if you don’t take the time to acknowledge they’re there. Taking a moment out of your day to take stock of the amazing elements in your life can greatly boost your level of happiness.
