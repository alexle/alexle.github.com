Development is fun for me because it’s an interesting puzzle. It’s like word legos except that you always find out about new pieces to use in your project. I absolutely love learning and it doesn’t matter much what it is as long as it can pull me in quickly. I spent days scouring Wookipedia when I found it, filling my head with useless information. Did you know that Tatooine used to be a rain-forest covered paradise until it was “glassed” by the Rakatan empire? source.

Tech is like that except the rabbit hole keeps going deeper and deeper. You can never really master it, and you can never really learn everything about it. It’s like the lore of a fictional universe where things keep moving. Moving so quickly, in fact, that you can never keep up even with the current-day stuff.

I love that. It’s fun. It’s fun that I can pull up 20+ articles today and learn something to use for my project for tomorrow. Did you know that ES6 allows you to use computed property keys? source.

So, I get to spend my time, my idle time, learning new stuff in an ever-expanding universe of programming and use that information for my day-job. Things keep changing so you never get bored and over time, as you learn more, new knowledge becomes easier to pick up.
