When it got tough in the later miles, there were no negative thoughts. Those thoughts were replaced with ones of a sense of gratitude. “Wow this is so cool. I’m around so many people doing what I love. People who are struggling, enduring, pushing, conquering. I love running.”



Until a few years ago, I had always thought of myself as a wanna-be sprinter. I loved the shorter distances, and if you had to pin me down I would probably say my favorite event was a road mile: Four minutes of sheer adrenaline and lactic acid! I thought I would be one of those people who runs one token marathon and calls it good. However, once I ran my first half marathon and started training for my first full marathon, I fell in love with long runs.

Now, 13.1 miles rarely feels long to me, and I run 22 to 24 miles every weekend when I’m marathon training—and I love it! If you want to push your limits and run farther, know it’s possible, and you may find yourself in love with long runs, too. Here’s how to get started:

Slowly Increase Distance

The first step in working toward a longer race is to slowly build one run (your longest) each week—to teach your body to conserve glycogen by burning fat as fuel. Moving into longer runs also helps build capillaries in your muscles, and both adaptations help improve your endurance.

Start by increasing the length of your run by no more than 20% each week, so if you are training for a half marathon, for example, and your longest run is five miles, don’t skip to eight the next week. Simply add one mile per week until you can comfortably build toward your race distance.  


Slowly Increase Volume

Boost your overall volume of weekly running by 10%—an amount low enough to avoid injury. If you can’t add more exercise days to your week, gradually increase the length of all runs and workouts, so you can get used to spending more time “on your feet.” Doing so helps your muscles adapt to the impact that comes with running, and it can help strengthen joints and ligaments, to better handle a longer race.  

You can also add cross-training to your fitness routine, to build endurance with less risk of overuse injury. I enjoy taking my outdoor elliptical trainer for a spin as it mimics the running motion without impact, and I can be out in nature. I also sometimes take a spin class where I hammer away to loud music and the orders of an instructor. Mixing things up can be as good for your mind as it is for your muscles.


. Running appeals to women because “if you put the work in, you can do it

“I like how uncomplicated it is compared to other sports,” she wrote in an email. “You just need the right pair of shoes and you can get out and go.”

There&#39;s a kind of man who is most comfortable when he is alone in nature. He may look normal, holding down a job and loving his family, going out for beers after work and making Sunday breakfasts. But he also just likes to get outdoors. This is the way he will say it. Not that he likes to be alone, or he needs to get away from anything. It&#39;s not a movement away; he&#39;s drawn toward something. Challenge is part of it.</p>
