You're Every Sign
Phyllis Firak-Mitz

Taurus - think of stable, strong-willed, determined, patient, loyal, deliberate, sure-footed, reliable, practical, methodical, preserverance, realistic, attentive.

Achieve whatever goals they set for themselves. Once identify something/someone they desire, they steadfastly pursue it.

Instead of expecting instant results, reach their goals step-by-step, knowing things worth achieving are worth working and waiting for.

Cultivate value and security in themselves and in the world.

Instead of needing things to go their way in the world in order for them to be satisfied or secure, they can be satisfied ans secure within themselves - no matter what is going on around them.

Gratitude is the secret to happiness for the Taurus. Reminds Taureans of the plenty they do have.

Earthiness of Taurus translates to a practical, black or white, approach to life. Either they want something or they don't. They like something or they don't.

They have little interest in considering ideas they can't prove or experience through their senses. If something works, show the, don't talk about it.

Taurus are solid folk. They do what they promise, call when they say they will, and are reliable to those around them.

They devote most of their time and energy creating whatever they believe will produce value, confort, safety, and stability.

Taureans can miss out on exeptional oopportunities because they are focusing on what they think they will lose rather than using their resourceful consciousness to recognize what they may gain.

When someone shows Taurus they like them, they are deeply touched and grateful. Me? You like me? Oh thank you! However, Taureans are not easily wooed away from established RL. Taurus is extremely faithful and committed. Once they give someone their heart, that's it. They don't look around wishing they were with someone else. Perhaps more than any other sign.

Strive to protect and provide for everyone they care for. Immense enjoyment from nurturing (children, spouses, family, friends).

Vulnerable in relation to love. Can get quite hurt when RL don't go well. Build shield of protection that is impenetrable to defned against getting hurt. Would prefer to feel nothing than to feel hurt.

Balance nature, able to express themselves in calm and steady and matter-of-fact way.

One of greatest gifts is resourcefulness. THey have keen eye for assets and opportunities that can further their goals.

Derive pleasure from and enjoy the simple pleasures of life. Life does not need to be complicated.

Losing security is their greatest fear. Can scare themselves with toughts of going broke, being unable to afford a home, food for sustaining life. Can allow this fear to run away with them, and imagine worst-case scenarios.

Can fear they aren't as strong or worthy as others, even if they are.

The Security Seeker

Financial security extremly important. Savings, investments, and possessions are foundation of Taureans' sense of well-being. Keen interest in financial status. Know at any given time exactly how much they have. Manage money wisely, thrifty. 

Knack for getting maxium return on their dollar. Will search for good deals. Will live below their means.

Being in debt is emotionally and psychically stressful for any Taurus. Cause anxiety.

Taurus fear of lack can actually create it. Instead of taking stock of what they possess, they believe they can't afford anything, even if in truth they can.

In these times, Taureans need to step back and practice gratitude. And remember that they always have the resources necessary to create security for themselves. This will open the flow of life's abundances.

When Taurens prefer to have material security, but don't need it to measure up or be secure, they are at their healthiest.

Sometimes Taureans energy will convince them they have to remain in situations that are limiting, even unhealthy, just because they offer security. They can believe they have no other means of support, even if that is rarely the case. It takes a lot for Taureans to finally get to the point where they'll leave a limiting, but secure situation.

Sometimes, Taureans mistakenly believe they are unworthy of love. They may not recognize love, even when love is being offered.

When Taureans have gratitude and appreciate for everything around them, they tap into a peace within themselves and recognize that nothing is lacking. That's when Taureans find inner fulfillment. From there, they can proceed in building outer fulfillment and abundance.

The Cultivator

They are hard workers, putting in extra hours, careful planning, and devoted loyalty that ensures their job will provide long-term sercurity so they can support themselves and their loved ones.

Generally, Taureans choose careers based on job security. Instead of entering exciting, yet unstable, careers, they will choose one that is dependable.

Taureans really live in their homes. They need a retreat from the world, and burrow in at home to be renewed and refreshed. That's where they choose to spend their quality time.
