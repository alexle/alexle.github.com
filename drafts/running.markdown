The Philosophy

The objective of all training is to achieve the greatest level of adaptation, not to become the most tired. Many times people train to get tired or to burn calories. Go ahead and burn calories if you want to work out and lose weight. That’s all well and good, but if you’re a high-performance athlete, whether your definition of high performance is finishing your first Olympic-distance race or trying to win the Ironman World Championship, the best way to achieve your goal is to have an adaptive response to training, which results in improvement, not to simply do more training. You want to do training that has an effect. There are some consistent themes in the way the most successful athletes train, and that’s really about a polarization of effort—workouts are either extremely easy or extremely hard, with almost no training in the middle, and that’s the crux of my philosophy.



When you hit mile 20 of the marathon, you can be the hunted or the hunter. I’ve run enough marathons to know that being the hunted and having some guy blow by you with a few miles to go, all because he ran a smarter race than you, is deflating. However, if you can master your training and pacing, there is no better feeling in the world than picking off others runners who are struggling in the later stages of a race.






On your very first run your body will have become suddenly aware that it needs to remodel to match its new training loads. Our muscular system responds to training easily, and can repair and rebuild in a matter of days. And, because the heart and lungs are part of this system they too will improve rapidly. After just a few runs, the cardiorespiratory system will become more efficient making you feel fitter and stronger. And this is at the core of where most new runners get into trouble. The tragedy is that other soft structures, connective tissues like tendons and ligaments, are just as weak as when you stepped out for your very first run. They are slower to repair and remodel than muscles, and about ten days in to your new regime, they will probably have completed the adaptation from only your first run.

In the first few weeks of a new exercise regime, you need to bear in mind that your tendons and ligaments are at least ten to 14 days behind how strong you might be feeling on any given day.

While it may be surprising to learn that two weeks into your new training schedule your bones are basically still those of a non-runner, the news is actually worse than this. Bone remodeling requires that some of the structure is destroyed (by a cell called an osteoclast) before it can be rebuilt. So, during your third week of running, feeling fitter and stronger, with some soft tissue adaptation beginning to take place, your bones are for a short period actually weaker than when you first started. By the fourth week, your bones will have succeeded to adapting to your first week’s run and so will be a little stronger. But they are always going to be a few weeks behind because contrary to popular belief running is very good for our bones, but density adaptation is comparatively slow.

While you’re just hitting your stride, your body is punishingly hard at work doing some miraculous things under your skin to adapt to your change of lifestyle; so be kind to yourself, take it slow, enjoy it, give your body the time and space that it needs, and you will be much more likely to make it to February.


"surrender to the experience"


changed the way i view the world and appreciate everything around me

“I’ve never been able to shake the feeling that I was created to do this, that I have a God-given talent for running long distance,” Crouch told Women’s Running. “I was asked recently what sacrifices I’ve made for the sport, and I had a hard time coming up with anything because this sport has never felt like a job to me. It feels like a privilege, something I am more than happy to give priority in my life.”

I feel like I can take big risks this year. That’s the beauty of being the defending champion. I’ve already accomplished what I really wanted, so now I have the ability to really do whatever I want." —@ShalaneFlanagan

“I don’t feel the panicky desperation to win—I am calm and calculated, but also willing to do big things.”






Doing Hard Things Give You More Pleasure
I always ran away from hard things. Improving yourself, working out, saving money, building a business, helping others, investing time in your relationship—it’s all hard when you do it right.

But doing those hard things will have more return on your life, time, energy, and money. When you do something that requires a lot of effort, you feel good about it. When you’re tired and still go to the gym for a hard work out, you feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that’s unrivaled.

It’s the same with your career. If you’re not doing hard things, don’t be surprised if you don’t feel alive.



Kipchoge is the type of person who says stuff like: “Only the disciplined ones in life are free. If you are undisciplined, you are a slave to your moods and your passions.” And: “It’s not about the legs; it’s about the heart and the mind.” And: “The best time to plant a tree was 25 years ago. The second-best time to plant a tree is today.”





“Get out there, see the world, exercise, feel good, do what you can for your mind and body. Life is short, enjoy every day.”



Simpson admits that she occasionally deals with a lot of the same frustrations that every runner deals with: fatigue, soreness, wavering motivation, and feeling out of shape after taking a break.



. I mean slowing down with the goal to make yourself a better and even faster runner.

“When you’re running slowly, and your injury risk is lower, you can run more often, more miles, and build up slowly,” according to Claire Bartholic, a coach at Runners Connect, an online community of runners and coaches. But running slowly also allows your body to improve the energy system most essential to running: your aerobic energy system. Your body relies on a few different energy systems to get you up and moving. For any sustained movement, it uses your aerobic energy system, meaning it creates energy with oxygen. Oxygen helps the muscles convert fat, protein and glycogen (the form of glucose stored in your liver and muscles, which your body generates from the carbohydrates you eat) into energy. If you want to be able to finish a marathon, for example, or even a 5K or a run around the block, this is the energy system you want to develop, says Bartholic, who is a competitive masters athlete herself. And to develop it, you should run at a pace where your muscles can get plenty of oxygen.



When you’re sprinting, or running so fast that you’ve reached your aerobic threshold, or, based on your level of conditioning, when your body runs out of oxygen, it switches over to another energy system — your anaerobic energy system. Without enough oxygen, your muscles convert glycogen into energy less efficiently, and you fatigue more quickly, which eventually forces you to slow down or stop. So if all your runs are too fast, according to Bartholic, you’re not developing the power system that you need for 97 percent of a race. “Your maximum aerobic benefit is going to be running slowly.”


“Run joyfully.” It is Goodman’s mantra, her website’s name, and what she tries to personify when she opens the door every morning to put in her miles. What does running joyfully entail?

“One, it’s really living off those endorphins,” she says. “I mean, how many runs do you ever regret going on? Nine out of 10 times, you feel better, happier, and have a clearer head for having spent a few minutes out in nature—or the urban jungle. The other half comes from a place of gratitude. Just appreciate the opportunity that you have to be out there.”

Tim Catalano, coauthor with Adam Goucher of Running the Edge, ran for the University of Colorado before getting advanced degrees in psychology and education. He says this approach is a good example of self-determinism. You can choose to focus on the positive or the negative in any endeavor and create your own experience. When Catalano tackled the six-day, 120-mile TransRockies Run stage race in 2015, he put that approach to the test.

“There are going to be some terrible times when you run 50 miles in a day or 120 miles in a week,” he says. “But what I chose to remember later—and what I chose to remember in the moment—was, ‘Holy crap, this is an amazing gift that I have a body that can do this. I’m in the middle of the Rocky Mountains with no one around, experiencing Colorado in a way that very few people get to.’ And when you hold on to those notions while running, you’re just happier.”

Controlling your mental outlook is no New Age gimmick, nor a call to abandon concrete goals. You can be a positive perfectionist. Eminent German psychologists Arne Dietrich and Oliver Stoll have published recent studies that show how perfectionism falls into two categories. Positive-striving perfectionism leads you to set high standards and benchmarks for your performance and helps you achieve your goals. Self-critical perfectionism, on the other hand, leaves you in a state of constant worry and disappointment and is correlated with anxiety, stress, and depression. Despite all their attention to detail, self-critical perfectionists were less likely to achieve their goals because any minor setback was seen as defeat.

This is one reason why experiencing running as an autotelic experience (one that’s enjoyed for its own sake) may be the key to running faster. Putting in more miles, doing quality work, and experimenting with different workouts become rewards, not chores, when pleasure is found in the act itself. That doesn’t mean every mile will be wonderful, Goodman says. But if you take a moment, even in the middle of a raging nor’easter or a tough workout, to remind yourself how fortunate you are to be running in the first place, then you’re more likely to appreciate the process.

“We don’t have the power to change an experience—an experience is what it is,” Catalano says. “But we do have the power to change how we experience that experience. You can let those dark voices [in your head] overwhelm you and have a bad day, or you can make the voices focus on all the good stuff, and it turns out to be a pretty amazing day. And the thing is, it’s the same damn day.”

What to Change: Enjoy running for running’s sake, not just for its outcomes.

Why: A happy, positive runner performs better and feels more satisfaction.

The challenge: Runners are competitive—we use the numbers to convince ourselves of our worth. It is difficult to accept the relativity of our performances and reframe our perspective. Plus, some days running just doesn’t feel good, and positive psychology can feel like a load of you-know-what.




Before we get into the actual workouts, we can’t forget one very important aspect that can influence whether or not your workout is a success or a failure.

Are you excited about the workout or were you intimidated as soon as you saw it on your training schedule? If you’re intimidated take the time to ask yourself why that is. The workout isn’t mean to hurt you, it’s meant to help you reach your goals. It’s an opportunity to improve. People often get caught up worrying about the pain a workout might induce, but often their present situation is pretty good and they’re letting it go to waste by worrying about a workout that isn’t even happening. Instead of worrying about something that isn’t happening, control the controllables!

If you do happen to have a bad workout, it’s okay! We repeat, it is okay! Everyone has them and a couple of bad workouts don’t mean you’re an awful runner. Instead of dwelling on a bad workout, ask yourself was it just one of those days or was something else was going on? Did you need more time to recover after a previous workout? Did you forget to take into account how a current stressful situation outside of running might affect your physical performance? Do you need to get more sleep? Do you need to work on positive self talk during challenging efforts? If you truly want to perform at your best, you have to be willing to ask yourself questions like this and then make a plan you can follow to help you with your next workout. A strong runner embraces all challenges head on, always willing to learn from both her/his successes and failures.



When nonrunners ask how long I’ve been running and I say 10 years, I get an expression of amazement, followed by, “You must really love it!” I smile and nod because I really do, except for the days when I really don’t. “It’s complicated,” I tell them.

Like every relationship, a running relationship goes through phases. When I first began, running was all I could think about. A year later, I loved running kind of like I loved my right arm; it was simply a part of me. By year five, I took running for granted. I recklessly increased mileage, got injured, and hated it for that. I considered quitting, looked into other forms of exercise, disliked those, and imagined returning to a sedentary life where I would grow old, fat, and depressed. As that stark potential reality sunk in, I realized running was worth fighting for. I threw on sneakers and clawed my way back, one slow mile at a time.





I thought about running, and I read about running, and I dreamed about running. While I can’t tell you exactly when it happened, that was the moment I realised that I now liked to run. It was no longer something I did just to maintain fitness, and to realise some random bucket list goal. Now I ran because I liked to run and because it had become a part of who I was. I had become a runner,



That said, I don’t think I am particularly talented or genetically gifted when it comes to running. To the contrary, I seem to require relatively high mileage to run similar times many other runners do with moderate mileage. You may need more time or less time than I did to build up to a sub-three-hour marathon or a similar age and/or gender graded time. I do believe everyone is capable of getting to that point, but it will take patience and consistent training over time. The idea here is to give you a good look at what exactly it took for one particular runner.





The volume and commitment was impressive, especially for a 36-year-old with considerable work responsibilities, but it proved unsustainable: By the end of the year I was burned out and running felt much more like work than play. Thankfully, this spring I found a way to avoid burnout while continuing to run, staying enthusiastic about my training, and satisfying my competitive fix. Instead of slogging around mountains at a slow pace for endless hours, I went in the opposite direction: flat, fast, and short. Time Management
To compete for 100 miles—or even 26—you almost can’t train enough. Usually the cap is determined by available time or injury, not by what’s required to maximize your potential. Last year, I was regularly training for 12 to 15 hours per week, not including midday recovery naps.

Training for shorter races, by comparison, is much more manageable and less disruptive to “adult” responsibilities like family, career, and home upkeep. I was running just five to seven hours per week and didn’t feel like I was undertrained for the race distances or being out-trained by the competition.

Novelty
Many runners are drawn to ultras because they enjoy running on trails and in the mountains and doing it all day. I totally get it.

But that can also become tedious, especially if you’ve run your local trails hundreds of times or if they’re covered in snow, ice, or mud. In this case, retreating to paved bike trails, quiet country roads, and the high school track can be a refreshing treat.

I find the experience to be more rhythmic, and I appreciate having my body shocked in a different way. Rather than my workouts being tests of attrition, they were dedicated to hitting my VO2max and improving my raw speed. It’s absurdly fun to finish a track workout with four 200-meter intervals, just as I did 20 years ago as a high schooler. Mentally, I’m more excited about running than I have been since last summer. I feel like I can embrace ultra training again. Physically, in some respects I’m better off right now than I was when on a dedicated ultra program. In particular, my running efficiency—the energy expended while running at a particular pace—has improved dramatically. When I started this training block, for example, running a five-minute pace felt like a sprint. Now I get that same sensation when running a 4:20 or 4:30 pace.

It seems hard to believe, but these running efficiency gains extend to ultra speeds as well. I guess we’ll find out how well my little experiment works in September, when I toe the line at the Run Rabbit Run 100-miler in Steamboat, Colorado.





However, when runners begin to improve rapidly, it’s often the fear of what were previously considered daunting paces or inconceivable goals that holds them back; it’s intimidating to believe that you can run a marathon 20 seconds per mile faster than what you considered your 10K pace not all that long ago. Succumbing to the awe of faster paces and how unbelievable it can seem to run that fast is often what leads to racing plateaus and time barriers that runners can never quite get past. Being aware of this phenomenon, understanding that other runners go through it as well, and implementing specific strategies to get over the mental hurdle is critical if you want to take your race times to the next level.
 





“In the end, all the small things make a big difference.  Every step is crucial.  Life isn’t about a single moment of great triumph and attainment.  It’s about the trials and errors that slowly get you there—the blood, sweat, tears, and the small, inconsequential things you do on a day-to-day basis.  It all matters in the end—every step, every regret, every decision, every minor setback and minuscule win. Persistence.  Not giving up on life.  Sticking to the tiny, healthy daily rituals we put in place for ourselves when we were at rock bottom—DOING THE HARD THINGS we knew we needed to do to be happy again.

I never would have been able to connect the dots looking forward, but looking backward I can see how every day, every step, every lesson, every deep breath, and every blog post mattered.  And this actually reminds me of another excerpt from Getting Back to Happy…




des_linden
Some days it just flows and I feel like I’m born to do this, other days it feels like I’m trudging through hell. Every day I make the choice to show up and see what I’ve got, and to try and be better.

My advice: keep showing up.



1. Let yourself slow down.

“The first two miles or so of every run, I feel like a newborn fawn. My legs have no idea how to work, things feel so unnatural and it’s almost as if I’ve never run a day in my life.” Schmidt overcomes those first-mile feelings by taking it easy, emphasizing consistency over speed. 3.Give yourself grace.

Schmidt wrote this down and put it on her fridge, a constant reminder to be patient with her journey. “Realize that you may not hit every mile every time, and that’s OK,” she says. “Training is a process, not a test. We are constantly growing and pushing and sometimes we don’t take the time to realize how far we have come, because we are so focused on where we are going.”



Google encourages its employees to stretch themselves, be ambitious, and embrace uncertainty. If you don’t get nervous or feel a little uncomfortable after setting a goal, then you haven’t reached high enough.

I love this quote that P&G CEO David Taylor shared on LinkedIn: “We all have to be willing to deal with a certain amount of discomfort in order to see what we’re truly capable of.”



Consistently good enough tends to = best over long-haul.

Better to be 80 percent 100 percent of time (0.8 x 1.0 = 0.8) than 100 percent 30 percent of time (1.0 x 0.3 = 0.3)

This math is especially powerful in endeavors that compound with consistency, or just about everything.





I am ready to tackle my next challenge. I keep reminding myself that I might not be the most talented athlete, but I work day in and day out for many years, and that matches and surpasses talent.
.
I am focusing on enjoying the moment and taking each opportunity that presents itself. The moment is now. I will try my best and work really hard TODAY and TOMORROW and every moment that I am awake!
.
I also have been talking a lot about not rushing fitness and that fitness will come when the time is perfect. I had a great workout on Friday, probably the best tempo run I’ve ever done were I went through the 10k sub 30:30. Today I had my best track workout so far, averaging 2:48 for 10 x 1k with 20 short hills in between and after. It was better than what I expected and I am really happy with it.


I really love improving and seeing what my personal potential is, and feel I have so much more room to improve in the full and half marathon, so it motivates me to see the limits of my God given potential!  And I really just love the process, regardless of the end result




Celebrate progress, no matter how small! Don't compare yourself to past workout times/ race results. Do new routes if you have to. Focusing on being grateful to be improving and to be back doing what you love!



“Running is such an accessible activity that people of all backgrounds and abilities can take part in,” Michael Capiraso, president and CEO of NYRR, tells SELF. “All they need is a pair of shoes and they’re good to go.” (Well, and maybe a supportive sports bra.) The goal of Global Running Day, explains Capiraso, is simple: for people around the world to celebrate the sport. “It’s a way for runners of all ages and abilities to share their passion for running and inspire others to get moving,” he adds.



The famous/infamous 20min 5k barrier is not just arbitrary, it’s more a result of how our culture sees running. 20min is a very achievable time for an recreational runner. However, today’s running culture tells us to run longer as opposed to faster, with marathons and the like becoming more and more accessible and well-attended. When trying to run a faster 5k, many runners keep upping their weekly mileage because it’s the only thing they know how to do. Thus appears the seemingly impossible sub-20 5k, because 6:30 is about as fast as most runners can go when all of their miles are at a 7:30-8:30 easy pace (about normal for just-over-20min runners).

The answer is unequivocally speed work. Get out on the track, get some faster stuff in. You can look up hundreds of different track/tempo/fartlek workouts for 5k runners. Find some and start adding them into your training. In addition to preparing your body, these workouts will also prepare you mentally. Take it from a sub-16 guy: it doesn’t get any easier as you get faster. If all of your training runs are at a comfortable pace, then you aren’t going to be physically or mentally prepared for the very uncomfortable pace of a 5k.





Sure, life gets in the way sometimes, but the beauty of running is that all you need is a pair of running shoes, shorts, a T-shirt. The hardest part of getting into running is getting your shoes on. The great part about being a runner is that I can do it anywhere, on vacation, shooting a project. I throw my headphones on, put on any type of music, and just get lost. I have had blissful moments on those runs. Some of the best were in Maui and Kauai. There are these great roads with offshoots where you can make your way down to a cove or a beach. Coming off a mile-and-a-half sprint, to breathe fully is an incredible feeling. It’s a nice way to check in with the universe.





Another tactic to surviving the pain cave Koop says is “making friends” with it. “The important thing is to recognize it’s a normal part of hard training or really long races and adventures,” he stated. “I make friends with the pain cave. I have even said to myself, ‘What’s up old friend?’” But mostly what seems to bring runners back to the starting line is a desire to push the limits. “I love the pain cave,” Nelson said. “I think as runners we are very fortunate to be able to explore the fringes of our potential as humans and the pain cave is the pathway we take. It is certainly fair to say it is an obsession, and one of my preferred pastimes.”


But don’t be mistaken: Her victory in Boston was anything but magic, luck, or whatever else goes into creating the happily-ever-after endings we see in the movies. Linden won because she consistently shows up, puts in the work, and then comes back the next day to do it all again. 


Secret: Have fun and smile

Let’s face it. Most of us aren’t going for an Olympic gold medal here. We are simply enjoying the challenge of doing our best. There is no real pressure, so quit putting so much on yourself. We run for fun, and you should remember that. Have fun! I encourage runners to smile a lot in the final days before a race. Smiling puts you in a better mood, and that can play a big role on race day.

It’s only through having a positive, happy mindset focused on doing your best, combined with a well-trained body that is rested but revved, fueled and hydrated that helps you race at your best.




A runner’s choice to push their body and mind to the brink must seem unfathomable from the outside looking in, but there is something about the sufferfest that keeps us returning. t’s not only in those racing moments, but in weekly training that the choice is made to put one’s self into a position of being uncomfortable; choosing to make your lungs burn, legs quiver and mind flutter between doubt and determination. But ultimately, it’s the determination that wins that battle, you get through the suffering and you are rewarded with knowing you’ve either achieved your goals or moved yourself closer to doing so. I searched my mind for the answer as to why I consistently make the choice to push. Sidenote: This is something that has to be kept in check, or injuries will prevail, as I’ve learned. As I thought about why I’m compelled to find that red line, it became evident that it’s the challenge, combined with having my goals in mind. Sure, it would be easy to sit at comfortable pace on the treadmill day in and day out, but I would be miserable. I love the pursuit of something difficult and working towards the goals I set out before myself. I think this is a common thread that weaves runners together, and keeps us coming back for more no matter the depth of the sufferfest.






I run for those who can't.  Simply stated, this is one of the most powerful motivators for me. Knowing that I am capable of something that some could only dream of doing is something that powers me through every tough step. I am so blessed to be able to do this sport and to be able to love it. I take for granted these feet, their abilities, this body...and during the tough runs, I often think of those who would give anything just to feel their feet pound the pavement. They inspire me to keep running.


I've had to reframe my goals. I will be ecstatic to run a sub-3 but if I come up short I will take pride in knowing this cycle has been the most consistent, disciplined, and highest mileage training I've ever done. I feel like I'm in the best running shape of my life regardless of what the finish clock tells me. All I can say is, enjoy the journey. Looking back I think more fondly of all ups and downs of training and the races in between than I do the race where I broke 3.




I think the biggest breakthroughs that I have had have been from consistent training. Working hard every day to get better than the day before and not missing days or doing huge miles one day and then nothing the next. Running is terrific in that you get better by running and the more you run the better it feels. I also know for me that I need to do some type speedwork /workouts to see big improvements which lead to breakthroughs.


Take risks—calculated and safe risks, of course. Take a leap of faith. Take a chance. Run an extra few miles. Go with a faster competitor in a race. Run a different distance.


Unfortunately there is no big secret. Breakthroughs happen when you consistently put in uninterrupted work day after day. Have a plan that sets you up to hit your goals. As you work through the training runs and workout sessions, you’ll gain fitness and confidence that you’re prepared for the big race . But don’t be a slave to what’s on the page and be sure to listen to your body. Staying healthy is key. Listen to your body and learn what pain to push through and when your body is telling you it needs rest and recovery. Trust your training. Even if you didn’t hit every workout, your plan should be building your fitness. Running is a process so you may not see all your gains immediately or all at once, but keep putting in the work. It will pay off down the line.

This is a project about two young women who have found a love for running and decided to take the challenge of becoming a Boston Marathon Qualifier. It requires a lot of hard work, consistency, and dedication to be able to achieve the standard. This is a video on their journey in an attempt to earn that standard.



When i was first getting into running, at the first half-marathon i ever ran, i was amazed at how fast some of the older people were they was so many that outpaced me easily, i dream of one day being an old man with a long flowing white wizard beard leaving all the youngsters in the dust.

That is a life goal of mine, just gotta keep it up for like another 40 years or so.


“Women are f****** tough, and then you add on the mom factor,” she said. “I know there are some really really great dads out there who would do anything for their kids, but there is something that a mom will do that’s way beyond.”




Age Is Only a Number
“Even though I’m 36, I decided to come back after New York because I finally felt the accumulation of all the work I’d put in over the past two-plus decades paying off. It’s like I was finally getting to the good stuff, coming around to the type of endurance runner I’d always wanted to be. I feel like I have more to give, and I’m excited by that. I’m in a major competition with myself. I want to explore my limits, to see what I’m fully capable of—and I think I still have a few special performances in me.”




Boston represents grit, determination, motivation, tears, blood and sweat. I worked so hard to get there. A relaxing training cycle wouldn�t feel right to me. Not giving it my all on Marathon Monday wouldn�t seem appropriate, given the training load and dedication it took to get there.

So, despite my road to qualifying for Boston 2018, I�m not running. Ultimately, I didn�t want to associate marathon training with pregnancy. They are both such large milestones that I want to enjoy, cherish and celebrate separately. I�m so excited and thrilled to be welcoming a baby girl (our first) into our world come early April. And I want to give her all of my attention and devotion.




On Why I choose #AnySurfaceAnyDistance: For starters I like the variety from 10km to 100-miles...I like trying to be versatile... and I like to jump in the big, competitive races! https://www.







chances are you have been bitten by the running bug. It can be hard to explain, as at some point you probably never thought you would end up enjoying running, but yet somehow it happened, and you are now a runner. Part of being a runner is wanting to do the best you can; chase down those PRs, and keep getting better.



.Running, or any outdoor workout for that matter, at times requires epic levels of motivation to get out the door. Throw in piles of snow, slick sidewalks, freezing rain, and short days, and that tiny bit of motivation that you did have could take a sudden nosedive. Who wants to go out running in that?





It was the 2015 IAAF World Championships, and Ashton Eaton was dead tired. Eaton, as you may know, is a two-time Olympic champion decathlete who some say is the greatest athlete of all time. Still, he had his work cut out for him: In order to break the world record, he needed to run faster than 4 minutes and 18 seconds in the final event, the 1500 meters?�?a significant challenge in and of itself. But here�s the thing: Eaton had already completed the other nine events in the decathlon, and he had more or less locked up a gold medal. In other words, he was exhausted and had little to gain from going all out, especially because the record he would be trying to break was his own, set a few years prior.

Nevertheless, Eaton decided to go for it. Why, you might wonder? He told the media that when the pain came on, �I was just thinking, it�s not for me so I have to go.� When further questioned, Eaton said, �Really I was just thinking about me sitting on the couch when I was little and watching somebody like Michael Johnson or Carl Lewis jump and run, and that�s the reason I�m here today. I thought maybe there�s a kid on a couch somewhere and if I break this world record they may be inspired to do something.� He ran the 1500 in 4 minutes and 17 seconds. n a paradoxical twist, the research suggests that the less we think about ourselves, the better we become. Self-transcendence not only allows us to overcome our greatest fears and break through our limits, but it also improves our performance in less heroic, everyday activities. . Perhaps this is why after unbelievable, record-breaking performances?�?ones that inevitably required enduring immense pain and suffering?�?athletes like Eaton never say they were thinking about how great it would feel to be a champion or how much money they would win. Rather, after crossing the finish line, they almost always report that when the pain came on, they began thinking about their family, their god, or their friend who has cancer. In other words, they were able to endure the pain, to say �more� when their bodies were screaming �less,� because they were supremely motivated by a self-transcending purpose.





And when you retire from being a pro runner after 12 years, you will be surprised at what ends up being most valuable to you. Your medals will be in a box somewhere, and you'll never look at them. Your proudest accomplishment will be a race in which you finished last because in that race you were tested more than ever and you were brave.

Finishing seventh in the entire world in the 5K and having a bronze medal in cross country brings you a smile, the same smile as winning league with your team as a freshman in high school, the same smile as breaking 5:00 in the mile for the first time. The real life-changers, the memories that make the peach fuzz on your cheeks and the hairs on your forearms stand up, those will be braiding your teammates hair in the 15-passenger van on the way to a race; a random tempo run along a sidewalk past a gas station where you felt like you were flying while home on Christmas break; descending a forest trail at camp behind your best friend with your arms outstretched in flight; running at night with someone you are falling in love with; pushing your baby in a running stroller for the first time; passing under a canopy of trees temporarily blocking the rain on a cross country course you can't remember the name of, the sound of your feet squelching in the mud while chasing your rival.

Protect the opportunity to make memories like those for a lifetime.







The world outside is beautiful. Running has exposed me to many wonderful and interesting places in the world that I would have otherwise missed.

On good days, it makes me feel strong and joyful. On bad days, it's a reminder that the hard and painful things don't last forever.



Eventually, I started walking, then running, slowly. The berating thoughts kept circling until I passed two women doing the 12-hour endurance race held on the same course. They�d been running for hours, but were smiling and joking. They didn�t appear to be caught up with winning or trophies. As I shuffled to the finish, I thought about the life I had, and how it was a pretty good one. In striving for what I thought I should have, I was missing what was already there. Why did I need to be in first when sometimes the best part of running�of anything really�isn�t the trophy but enjoying the course?


Writing (and other work). I've saved the best for last. Writing is my passion. This is what I was meant to do. I wake up early to write. I stay up late to write. When I go for long walks alone, I'm thinking about writing. While I'm still very much an amateur, I improve every day that I write. I'm so thankful that I get to do this.

The Internet Retirement Police may call my writing a job or work. And they'd be right. This task that I perform makes money. However, the first 3 years that I worked on the blog, I made under $100. It was a passion project and still is. Call it work if you want to, but I'd much rather be doing this than watching TV, shopping, reading celebrity gossip or whatever some others consider fun activity.




Don't hold your farts in, let them propel you to the finish line.




Running is meditative, it's peaceful and once you break through the uncomfortable pain of starting, the pain begins to become a pleasure which is rewarding on so many levels.


Once you learn the way, however, running provides a predictable path to satisfaction. I can control running variables far easier than I can relationships, work, or community, and the payoff is never disappointing. Running is what I turn to when I�m tossed about and need to know that, at least in one area, I can act on my world and be confident it will respond and reveal that place where life resonates in harmonic frequencies.



I feel light and balanced, a fine-tuned machine. I�m breathing hard and my heart pounds in my chest, but I�m in control. I fly over the ground, driving myself faster as I descend the hill and hit the final straight.

I can sense tumblers falling into place, unlocking the �thing behind everything� that makes all else seem second-rate, as John Updike described in Rabbit, Run. I�m riding the wave, hitting the sweet spot, in the zone, in flow. As I finish the workout, I feel invincible, fully alive, connected and powerful.

The next day, the feeling is there again as I accelerate to a cruising rhythm on an eight-miler. At this more relaxed pace, power plays second fiddle to a consciousness of deep strength, the �tireless state� that legendary New Zealand coach Arthur Lydiard spoke about. It lures me to extend my run two extra miles, then four. I roll along, barely touching the ground, feeling like I could run over the horizon.



The longer the race distance, the more important the mind is in determining success, because it determines how much you will train and how much discomfort you are prepared to accept in training and racing.�



eat, sleep, train, rest

I'm strong, I'm fast, my speed will last




I am an avid runner, and I freely admit that running is my therapy. No matter how stressful or difficult life is, I finish every run feeling accomplished, relaxed, and happy.




�I love the results�running faster, running longer, going after a clear-cut goal, ..  told me one thing running offers that her job often doesn�t is �methodical process and simplicity. Whether it�s an easy run or a tough workout, it feels good to lock into a pace and go for it.� .. why people with desk jobs are attracted to grueling athletic events. They interviewed 26 Tough Mudder participants and read online forums dedicated to obstacle course racing. What emerged was a resounding theme: the pursuit of pain. .. . �When leaving marks and wounds, pain helps consumers create the story of a fulfilled life. In a context of decreased physicality, [obstacle course races] play a major role in selling pain to the saturated selves of knowledge workers, who use pain as a way to simultaneously escape reflexivity and craft their life narrative.� .. �Triathletes who I interviewed for my research talked about how the pain that they experienced during training and racing was one of the primary reasons they did it,� says Bridel. �To overcome this pain and get across the finish line served as a significant form of achievement and demonstrated an ability to discipline their bodies.� .. The great irony, of course, is that one of the main reasons people pursue education, financial security, and solid employment is to create comfortable lives. But for some, this can begin to feel like too much of a good thing. Endurance sports provide a necessary outlet, offering concrete measures of a job well done and the chance to deal with physical suffering�albeit in a voluntary, defined, and immediately escapable environment.





I�ve been running a lot lately doing 5-6 runs a week which has been about 60kms total. These sessions are varying in intensity and difficulty but they�re all hard there�s no getting around that.
Doing high mileage means you�ll feel like crap on some days. Your body just feels weak and your mind asks itself why are your doing this type of exercise? Why not a nice easy team sport? These are tough days. But it�s still a rough time and there are moments where you think all is lost and running sucks. At those moments you have to look on the bright side and the positives of running.
Me and a mate of mine talked about these positives a couple of days ago. They are as follows:
So firstly with running you can put in as much or as little time as you like. You�re not pissing away time like with many other sports. Every session counts and it�s all on you.
Secondly, people all around the world run. You can go anywhere and do it. Hell, my mate just did a marathon in Switzerland and I trained with a bunch of people in the US. Building upon that, I think it�s one of the best social sports. I still run with people who I knew as a kid. We would never have met and we wouldn�t still connect if it wasn�t for running. Running is a great way to spend your time catching up with mates but also be fit.
Thirdly, running is one of the best goal setting sports as like I said it�s all on you. There are no other factors to stop you doing from what you want to do... maybe apart from injuries.
Fourth, running gear is relatively cheap, you don�t need a ball or a stick or some kind of machine to do it.
And lastly, and I think almost most importantly for me, tech is making running a more appealing activity to do. There are sports social media apps like Strava that are gaining in popularity and I think that momentum will only continue. This is because more and more people are buying wearables like Apple and Garmin watches because they are getting cheaper and just more useful. So the data you can collect about your run is getting better and easier to collect and then compare with mates. Or you can even analyse other athletes to see how they train and how you might be able to replicate what they do.




10 years ago I was barely a runner. Last night @JaredMilesUltra & I put in for #Hardrock100. 

Filed under: Things I never thought possible.





I should love making it to tapering time, but the truth is, I hate it.

My body has oddly gotten used to long training days, and now I feel almost �off� when I take it easy�edgy and restless. I am accustomed to waking up at the crack of dawn, which is the only way to train in this heat!

So sleeping in (until seven or eight) makes me feel lethargic and weird. I feel like a racehorse trapped behind the gates at the starting line, waiting for the gun�nervous and twitchy, chomping on my bit.

Slowing down means I am less tired, which means I have more energy to be anxious and overthink things. I am training less and doubting more. Can I really do this? Do I have what it takes? Am I ready? Am I packing the right things? What am I forgetting? What haven�t I thought of? What more can I read?

Taper is more exhausting than training. I am the type of girl who is more comfortable with working hard rather than wondering if I have worked hard enough. My beloved wingman Paige has trained her ass off with me, even though she isn�t joining me on the trip. She keeps telling me to take it easy and trust my training. She reminds me that all I can accomplish by pushing myself at this point is get hurt, sick, or overtired. I know she is right, but it feels somehow wrong.

I either have it, or I don�t. I either packed right, or I didn�t. I will either find my grit, or come up short. And the only way to find out is to go there and try.





It�s your brain. Your brain is hardwired to prevent you from damaging your body with a dangerous effort. Therefore, you have to teach it that 5K races are safe. The easiest way to do that? Race a 5K!





Lesson #1: Go as fast or as slow as you feel like

First graders don�t run fast because they know it�s interval day. They run fast because they feel like it and because running fast is fun. They don�t pace themselves, or think about rest periods, or worry about if their heart rate is in the right zone. They run the way their body tells them to run.

Lesson #2: Ditch the data

Go ahead, leave the Garmin at home today. We promise, your body won�t care whether or not your workout was posted to STRAVA. Kids don�t count their steps, track their weekly running mileage, or know their 10k pace. Instead of data-driven workouts, give yourself a real-world challenge every once in a while. Can you make it to the top of the hill in time to see the sunset? Can you run all the way to the grocery store on the other end of town � and all the way back carrying a jar of spaghetti sauce? Can you squeeze in your regular neighborhood loop before that rerun of Seinfeld comes on?

Lesson #3: Make it up as you go 

Know where you�re going to start and where you�re going to end. In between, let curiosity guide you. What�s around that corner? Where does that trail lead to? Don�t be irresponsible about it (you don�t want to pay for that helicopter rescue, do you?), but a little bit of route deviation can be fun.

Lesson #5: Do it because it�s fun

The golden rule of running. The reason we do it day after day. Kids don�t run to be the fastest, or the fittest, or so that they can eat three cheeseburgers and still fit into their favorite jeans. And when it comes down to it, neither do we. We run because it�s fun. Pure and simple.




If you�ve ever done a race, it�s highly likely you�ve had some of the following thoughts:

�This is terrible. I�m terrible. Why do I even do this? Is it ever going to end? Everything hurts and I suck.�

Almost all athletes find themselves performing mental somersaults in the midst of hard racing. And, once we�re done, almost all of us think we could have gone harder if only we�d been mentally tougher.





when I began running as a high-school junior, it seemed a risky business. So many people warned that I would end up a wreck. My heart would grow weak with fatigue. The disks in my back would be ground to dust. My knees, if they moved at all, would creak and groan.

I even detected hints that my brain would turn to mush. �What do you think about when you�re running?� I was asked with clear disdain. �It�s so boring.�





Last week, I began tapering for an upcoming marathon.

Were I a rational person, I would use my newfound free time to conquer my neglected to-do list or treat myself to a relaxing massage. I would sit on my front porch and drink a cup of tea while smiling at all the poor saps who still have long runs on their calendars. I would do the charity work I promised the Endurance Gods all those times I begged them to just make the weather suck a little less for today�s run, please.

Then again, I suppose if I were a rational person, I wouldn�t be running a marathon in the first place.

Instead of using my wide-open schedule to relax and bask in the glory of all that is taper, I�ve been doing the same thing I�ve done before every race: panic.







One of the mystifying and miserable things about running is that no matter how long you�ve been running, there will come a point where it feels really, really hard. Whether you�re in the middle of your very first mile or your 5,000th, sometimes the sport we are trying to love seems impossible. These tough times may last for mere moments (until you reach the top of that endless hill) or for months on end. It�s enough to make you wonder why you even bother. For me, that time comes every single summer, when I�m staring down the barrel of seemingly endless months of heat and humidity that make me consider quitting the sport altogether.

But here�s the thing: running isn�t supposed to be easy. For some of us, it may never truly feel effortless like it seems to for others. Take comfort in knowing that you�re not alone. There are people out there who are laughing right along with you at the idea of an �easy� run. Running is hard, and those of us who go out there willingly and do it anyway are pretty unique. No matter how bad a run goes, the fact that you got out there and did it anyway (especially if you had a feeling it was going to be a bad one) is commendable.

We are always capable of just a little bit more than we think�especially when it comes to running. Our minds tend to quit long before our bodies do. So the next time you�re struggling, ask yourself if you have one more minute in you, one more mile, one more run, one more race. Sometimes the answer will be yes, and sometimes the answer will be no. Giving that last little bit is a huge confidence booster that will stick with you and remind you that you can do more than you think you can.




running is a big question mark that's there each and every day. It asks you, "Are you going to be a wimp, or are you going to be strong today?"


Choose to slow down now or be forced to slow down later,"

Running frees the mind. It�s amazing how refreshed and recharged one can be after a 30-60 minute run if the mind is free to �associate� and reconcile conflicts and issues. Music, on the other hand, is distracting. As I type, I�m having trouble getting the song �My Sharona� out of my head � and it�s been at least 15 years since I�ve heard that song on the radio.




I started running as an outlet for mental clarity and time with myself. As I grew up, it also became a way to set goals and to attain them�to push myself, and to be a better athlete. When I was a year out of college, I decided I wanted to train for my first marathon�and my lord, was it humbling. Realizing I was expected to train at least five days .. t the end of the race, and at the end of the day, I run for those who can�t, who are pushing themselves through their own marathons in life. I work out because I can.�


My favorite climb in Boulder is Sunshine Canyon. I can't tell you how many times I've ridden it. It's been a space for all kinds of experiences- freezing in the dead of winter riding this climb, crashing on ice, being blown off my bike, getting dropped... but also days feeling strong and seeing improvement, feeling lucky for the sun and the views. Fitness is a foundation built on showing up day after day. I showed up for 8 years to this climb and it means a lot to me that the hard work I put in helped me achieve my goals and that I had good, bad, and ugly days in this little corner of a nature. So many awesome memories and so happy to make more!!




Practice the art of visualization, which will help you stay relaxed, controlled, and running mentally tough during your race. It will also help reduce the amount of nerves and anxious energy leading up to the big day and the starting line.

The more you practice visualization, the more effective this training tool becomes. Begin by closing your eyes in a quiet space and picture yourself from warm-up all the way through to the finish line. Use as many details as you can and incorporate as many senses as possible, making it feel most realistic. Pay special focus to the points of the race when the pain will inevitably start becoming more present. Then, practice feeling relaxed and confident. Remind yourself you�ll be sure to keep your form efficient, key off of the runners around and ahead of you, and how you will combat any negative thoughts.

The better able you become at tapping into that smooth, relaxed space before the race, once you�re actually experiencing it, it will feel rehearsed. You�ll then know how you will want to run. Remember you are strong and capable of running tough all the way through to the finish line. Motivation Tasks

Reminding yourself just how hard you�ve worked and the goals you have for this race will keep you on point and focused when things get uncomfortable. Motivation during these times is crucial, spend some time during the taper weeks on motivational tasks.

Find a power mantra that you will recite when the pain of racing sets in. Keep it short and pick words that really resonate with you. If you�re going to be racing with music, come up with a playlist, putting the most upbeat songs at the points in the race you�ll need the extra motivation the most.

Finally, tap into your creativity and make a motivational poster. Use pictures, sayings, even previous race bibs that are meaningful to you. Come up with true meaning behind the race at hand so when things start to hurt you can close your eyes and remember WHY you are running.




As most runners know, the body relies heavily on carbohydrates to produce energy during training and racing. Put simply, when you eat carbohydrates, they are stored in the body as glycogen, which is then used as fuel. But you�re only capable of storing so much glycogen. Once you burn through it, you are forced to rely on utilizing fat, which is a less efficient fuel source. This is the point at which you �hit the wall.� Your pace slows as pain and fatigue set in, and there�s little you can do about it.



She helped me maintain high (for me) mileage without getting injured or sacrificing quality workouts. By the end of my training cycle, I felt confident, strong, and better prepared than I'd ever been to race 26.2. I imagined myself crossing that Wineglass finish line victorious, exhausted but not wrecked, with a huge PR to show for it

I h-h-h-hate marathons,� I choked out between sobs to my sympathetic fianc� (who'd heard all this before). �Why do I do this to myself? I'm never running one again.�

Crossing the finish. Nathan Perkel
That was a lie, of course, but every marathoner should ask herself, Why do I do this? Why train for months for one painful day that will take weeks to recover from? Why shell out the cash to hire a coach (I paid $130 per month to work with Shay) if a perfect race isn't guaranteed?

To me, one of the perks of training for a marathon was avoiding the all-out, lungs-and-legs-burning, I-can-taste-blood kind of speed-work that 5K runners endure regularly. Most runners have stronger engines compared to the structure needed to support the engine,� Shay replied. �The goal of hill sprints isn't necessarily speed but the ability to recruit more muscle fibers as you fatigue in workouts and races.�



�Running and training has given me so much pleasure in my life,� says the 28-year-old, who is currently training for Ironman Wisconsin as part of the Make Me an IRONMAN campaign. �I�ve learned so much about myself, beat depression and realized I have all I need to make myself happy.�


running - meditative, exercise, hobby/passion

It clicked for me when I saw how calm it made me, and how it helped me settle my thoughts. I later learned to love the setting goals and seeing improvements aspect of running too, but the first thing I actually loved was the meditative aspect of it. You have uninterrupted time to yourself and your thoughts. I still love that part the most.


8. We Are Consistent

If you ask any runner who wins races about their �secret sauce,� chances are good they�ll taut the benefits of consistency. But that doesn�t mean you have to run every day. It does mean establishing a routine, even a loosely structured one, such as having a long run on Sundays, a tempo day on Tuesdays and using Thursdays for speed work. And once you have a plan, you have to follow it. Schedule training sessions like meetings and stick to your schedule. A routine will help you know what to expect mentally and physically. You accept it. Your body accepts it. Your family and friends accept it. Your significant other who feels neglected accepts it. And before you know what�s happened, training and running becomes a regular part of your life.

9. We Cross-Train

To quote Jack Nicholson�s character from �The Shining:� �All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.� The same can happen with running day after day. Mixing up your routine by adding in swimming, skiing, weight lifting, cycling, yoga or a new class stimulates your mind, gives your body a break from the same repetitive motion by engaging different muscles and keeps training entertaining. Cross-training also helps runners increase upper body and core strength (and makes you look good!), contributing to improved form and running efficiency.

We Are Open to New Things

Minimalism, maximalism, carbo-loading, Paleo, heel striking, barefoot running�all the theories and trends can leave you running in circles. Still, there is much to be gained from paying attention to the latest research and innovative products. Sure, you can do things the way you�ve always done them, but the learning process that comes with trying a new training method, running in a different style of shoes or switching up your routine can make you a better, healthier and happier runner. There is no one �right� shoe, eating method or running form for everyone. But a wide variety of ever-evolving options give more people the opportunity to enjoy running to the fullest�including you.

We Get Plenty of Sleep

You know you need more sleep, but you just don�t have the time�too bad. According to recent studies, getting enough sleep not only helps with concentration (imperative for overanalyzing race splits) and makes it easier to shed pounds and maintain weight loss (those 1 a.m. cupcake cravings are your sleepy head talking, not your belly), but it also helps bodies to heal and recover from exercise. How much sleep is necessary varies from person to person, but aiming for seven to nine hours a night is a good goal. Power naps work too, as long as they don�t interfere with a solid, rejuvenating sleep cycle. Think of it as active recovery!

We Always Have a Goal

Training for a race provides instant structure to your running in the form of a training plan and a race date. Guesswork is taken out of the equation and inspiration is a given. No, you don�t always need to have a race on the calendar, but how else are you going to get new tech T�s? If racing isn�t your thing, try running a new route, booking a running vacation, increasing your mileage, running with a group once a week or seeing if you can increase your speed. It�s hard to stay engaged without something on the horizon. The idea is to give purpose and energy to your running. Remember, this is fun! (And a totally acceptable goal is beating your running partner. We won�t judge.)

We Have a Favorite Shoe Among the Hundreds

Runners are pack rats�we save all our medals, bibs, moldy water bottles, training logs, sweat-stained everything and, most importantly, shoes. But underneath the pile of mismatched brands, dirt and offensive aromas lies the golden ticket�the one pair of trainers that never disappoints and always leaves us satisfied. We love to test new shoes and products and brag about new brands we saw first, but we always come home to our one and only, that one model that gets us to the perfect stride every single time. And when the shoe is tired and worn, we buy the exact same one (usually an updated version with some minor tweaks). Of course we don�t toss its predecessor; it�s just added to the pile of crap in the back of the closet.

We Have Running Gear Ready�At All Times

In the office, at the cube, under the car seat, in the trunk, on the floor�there�s running gear EVERYWHERE. You never know when you might have to grab a few miles away from the computer. You know how your mom always told you to have a designated driver? Be the designated runner�if you�re ever stranded in the middle of nowhere with 10 miles to go until civilization (at least we think it might happen), you always have already worn socks and your backup-to-the-backup shirt. If your co-workers scrunch their faces in disgust at the idea of a lunchtime jaunt, keep your handy gear in a desk drawer or in your car. Just don�t leave the Body Glide out in a public space.

We Hydrate Often

Drink water! It helps you stay alive, hydrated, healthy and functional during those longer runs and races. Neon sports drinks are never out of style either, replenishing electrolytes and salt lost during a good sweat session. Our back seats and trucks are cluttered with half-drank water bottles and questionable concoctions our friends told us we HAD TO TRY. It�s also no coincidence that beer miles are totally trending�runners love beer more than Gatorade. We drool over the easy carbs and calories our favorite brew offers. Guzzling one or five beers after a hard run is just as beneficial (and necessary) as chugging H20 on a daily basis. OK, maybe water is a smidge more important, but don�t underestimate the power of the brew.






7. They recognize and celebrate their achievements�no matter how small.

As highly effective runners, we are always looking ahead toward the next goal, which is an integral part of continual improvement. Equally important, however, is that we take the time along the way to recognize and celebrate our achievements, no matter how trivial they may seem.

The most highly effective runners don�t undervalue their accomplishments. Every time you cross a finish line, even if it wasn�t the big personal best you were hoping for, be grateful for that performance. Race results are never guaranteed�personal bests even less so. Every finish line is worthy of at least a small celebration.

And when someone congratulates you after a race, even if it fell short of what you were setting out to do, be gracious and just say thank you. No one likes an unappreciative runner. Even if you�re disappointed with your performance, someone watching might be inspired by it, and that�s certainly an unintended achievement worth celebrating at the end of the day.

Finally, the most highly effective runners know that every day they�re able to get a run in is worth recognizing and celebrating, even if that celebration is as simple as high-fiving a training partner after a tough workout or cracking a satisfactory smile following a solo long run in bad weather. Never lose sight of the fact that you�ve achieved something!


running rest - As you rest � sleeping, relaxing on the couch on Saturday afternoon, or engaging in something slightly more active, such as your easy run days or appropriate warm-ups and cool-downs � you are reaping the benefits from your hard workouts. Stressed bones, broken-down muscle tissue, and exhausted energy systems are repairing themselves to come back stronger for your next workout and power you to a higher level of performance.


i run for the love of running, for the love of the process, to see the small improvements build up over time.


Alan Smith my training is also unstructured. I'm 49 and clock up on average 100kms a week. I run because I freaking love it and if I followed a structured training plan, I don't think I'd feel the same way about running and could perhaps push me toward injury. I come up with a new challenge at the beginning of every week. It might be elevation, distance, pace or to explore new trails. I feel fitter and healthier than I've ever been in my entire life! Running has been a lifesaver for me when it comes to depression. ?







We proceed to run the 6+ mile loop of Central Park on a whim.
I experience a sensation that feels like death for roughly 4 of those miles.
I spend the next week in pain.
I come to the distinct realization that I am out of shape.
So I went for a run. And then another. And another. I started out running 20-ish minutes at a time. I was convinced that I had to be covering a respectable 2 miles as I whipped myself into shape. (Yep, it was about 1.25 miles.)

I never intended to become a runner. I just wanted to get in shape and lose some weight. Running was easy to manage. I could do it anytime, anywhere with just a pair of shoes and some workout clothes. Over time, that 1.25 miles became 5k. That became 10k. Somewhere in there I ran my first half marathon. And more importantly, I started to care. 

I was hooked.





A race is the final to my running. Without one, I can put in mindless daily runs and get by, not knowing or caring about details or results. Without consequences, my focus wanders.

Add a race and everything matters. I track my miles, pace, and heart rate. I dig deep and do speedwork, playing with reps and recoveries to work every system�and I actually go easy on easy days. I do supplemental strength and flexibility exercises. I turn down the second cookie. I pay attention to my form, cadence, and efficiency. I note what works and what doesn�t. My runs, indeed all of my life, become part of a grand experiment I never tire of.

I love running all the time, but both it and I are at our best when I�m training for a race, studying for a final.




I�ve been running regularly for nearly 40 years. I love getting outdoors, feeling fit and fast, the mental clarity, the endorphins.


Take risks�calculated and safe risks, of course. Take a leap of faith. Take a chance. Run an extra few miles. Go with a faster competitor in a race. Run a different distance. 


Unfortunately there is no big secret. Breakthroughs happen when you consistently put in uninterrupted work day after day. Have a plan that sets you up to hit your goals. As you work through the training runs and workout sessions, you�ll gain fitness and confidence that you�re prepared for the big race . But don�t be a slave to what�s on the page and be sure to listen to your body. Staying healthy is key. Listen to your body and learn what pain to push through and when your body is telling you it needs rest and recovery. Trust your training. Even if you didn�t hit every workout, your plan should be building your fitness. Running is a process so you may not see all your gains immediately or all at once, but keep putting in the work. It will pay off down the line.










The key for your own training is to embrace the process of long-term improvement, rather than stressing out over short-term expectations. No one workout, race or even training cycle is particularly important. Instead, make decisions (like whether to start a race or force a workout) with the zoomed-out, long-term wisdom of who you might become, rather than who you currently are.

If you do that, you might become someone even more remarkable than you could ever imagine.




a lot of people run a race to see who's fastest .. i run to see who has the most guts .. steve prefontaine



Motivation

One day you won�t be able to do this, today is not that day.

I think about how much I will regret it if I bail on a workout or give up halfway through. I was told by a friend that no-one can do it for you, and when it comes to race day, only you know whether you�ve given your all in both training and during the race. I like to know I�ve given everything I have, that way whatever the result, I can be proud of myself.



What�s your favourite type of workout and why?

I love running. Whether it�s an easy run with friends, a hard workout like mile repeats (I actually love the speed workouts), or a race I�ve been training for over a couple of months.

I like the challenge both physically and mentally that comes with running. Plus it�s free and can be done pretty much anywhere!



 While other kids thought of it as punishment, it was her joy. "I loved pushing myself," she recalls.

ESPN: What strengths do you carry into the longer distances?

Hasay: I think it's the ability to be able to stay relaxed and handle the adversities. I've learned that in the course of a marathon and some of these longer tempos and such, there's going to be a lot of ups and downs. Usually when I'm doing a long run, at two miles in, I feel like I'm going to die. But then you just move through it, so [you] just [need] the ability to stay patient and stay relaxed. I've always been good about staying relaxed in races and sort of tuning out. I don't mind just grinding on, so I think that fits well with the marathon.


"I may never have another chance to run down the finishing stretch in the Olympic marathon ever again. I'm going to run it as hard as I can!" Jared Ward


Understand That There Will Be Highs and Lows in Life

Mentally tough people don't expect life to be sunshine and roses all the time. In fact, they expect adversity, but they have faith in their abilities to survive, adapt, and overcome.


First week, ugh. Second week, less ugh. Third week, okay. Fourth week try to channel those who run on this oval at top speeds. Make the last one the best one, they say.

#LastOneBestOne, they tweet. Last one best one is where they grow.

Go x9. Three more. Last three best three, I say. Nail it on 10. Nail it on 11. Last one left. No bailouts.

Fine. Go.

Last one best one, I crush.



My alarm goes off early Saturday morning. Though I am tired, my excitement overcomes my fatigue and I quickly get ready. My mom drives me and my sister to the park where the meet takes place. I learn the course during the walk through, and my anticipation grows. I stretch, and jog around the park to warm up. Finally, the person that runs the meet calls us to the line.

We step back, and they go over the rules. My stomach churns and I become scared. All of a sudden he says, �Take your mark,� and everyone steps forward. The alarm goes off and I run. I begin to sprint, weaving through the crowd to get toward the front. I forget about everything as my feet kick up dust. I start off fast but slow down once I am far from everyone else. My feet hit the ground making a familiar sound. I race up and down hills, and around corners. Then I see the finish line. It is far at first, but grows closer. I sprint. My legs hurt, but I ignore it.

I pass my parents and my sister standing on the outside of the course. They cheer, making me run faster. I can feel the wind in my hair, and for a minute it feels like I am flying. I sprint through the flags, and a wave of happiness passes over me. They hand me a card and I put my name tag on it. This way, they will know who got each place, and be able to call us up to get our ribbons.

Running make me feel alive and like I can do anything.

Goals help me do my best. If I did not make goals, I would not be as determined to try hard. I have made many goals throughout my life and accomplished most of them. My biggest long term goals for running are to make the Olympic team and get a running scholarship. When I watch the Olympics, I am inspired. If you make the Olympic team you are one of the fastest runners in the world. I think that would be amazing. Because that is a long time away, I have many short-term goals, including getting first place in a middle school race, and getting under 22 minutes in a 5K.

Accomplishing a goal is like taking a bite of ice cream. It sends a rush of satisfaction through my body and makes me feel like I am invincible.

Running makes me feel free and helps me forget everything. When I run through the finish I am filled with determination and energy, I feel like I can do anything. One of my favorite quotes is:  �One run can change your day, and many runs can change your life.�

Whenever I feel sad, running can help me feel happy again.




Dear 7-year-old me:

You don�t know it yet, but after this lap with your dad around the neighboring town�s high school track, you�ll be hooked. Running will be your escape from any worries that could possibly fill a 7-year-old�s mind.you�ll realize that your identity as a runner lies so much deeper that in the physical act of running itself. It lies in the work ethic, values, and life lessons that running has taught you. It lies in the friends you�ve made, in the pasta dinners, in your punctuality, in your heart. It lies in the laughing fits and inside jokes made in the back of the cross country bus.Running will be your personal therapist, your drug of choice, your silence in a noisy room. Running will make you feel more alive that you�ve ever felt anywhere else.Running will teach you that your limits are much, much farther away than you think they are. Running will teach you how to fall down over and over and over, then stand back up with a desire to succeed.

Most importantly, running will teach you how to practice gratitude�for the fact that you�re even a fraction of a percent better than you were the day before, for friends and family that are supporting you, for the fact that you�re still able to be active and competitive, and most importantly, for all that you have gained from running.







Racers
A classic racer can be identified by the following characteristics and tendencies:

� Enjoys racing, typically likes to race more than train
� Does not necessarily set goal times for races, just wants to �win�
� Focuses more on place than time
� Commonly goes out hard and runs positive splits
� Tends to do well, as long as there is competition
� Struggles to run even races, especially the longer the distance
� Can struggle alone in training
� Tends to have a good kick

Racers can achieve great success when they are running well and winning. For some, this may actually mean winning races, for others it might mean placing high in their age group or winning medals. The downside is when racers have a few bad races it can really hurt them. A racer must learn that you can�t win every race, and sometimes it is better to run a faster time and lose than to run a very slow time and win. A racer must work to run with more control and pace more effectively.

Pacers
Pacers can be identified by the following characteristics and tendencies:

� Typically is over-anxious and experiences a high level of race anxiety
� Very focused on time and splits, less focused on overall place
� Tends to over-think racing
� Commonly runs even splits or negative splits
� Tends to struggle in bad conditions when the environment is less controlled
� Struggles to run fast in shorter races, due to a lack of aggressiveness
� Less of a kicker than a racer, has a pretty good kick, due to a proper pacing strategy

Pacers tend to run with their heads and not their hearts. This allows them to pace effectively and run very consistent races. However, pacers often lack ambition and run too conservatively. This can lead to a lack of major breakthroughs when it comes to race times. A pacer is more afraid to fail than a racer. The pacer may run consistent times but might have PRs slower than someone with the same ability, but with a more ambitious racing strategy.




Tempt failure.

March right up to it. Always write as if you�re about to fall on your face. Add fire. Bring the char. Toss in a weird ingredient. 

I�m not saying anything particularly new here. The cliche, true enough as many cliches are, is no risk, no reward. Just the same, what often marks some of the greatest fiction � or, put differently, some of your favorite fiction � is a willingness on the part of the creator to take those risks, to march into the gloom of uncertainty into a place where every step might lead to a sucking mire or a starveling beastie. Some of the best work is done when it�s done by an author who knows what they�re about to do is not precisely advisable, or entirely safe, and yet they say, fuck it, fuck this, fuck that shit, I�m doing it anyway, motherfuckers. They broke a rule. They took a thing long past its expected arc. They blew up a trope or juked right when everyone else would�ve gone left. They tried something new, and it either pays off or it fails spectacularly. And honestly I�d rather read something that fails spectacularly than something that just kind of� putters along in the manner of an elderly dachshund.

You grill a steak, what happens? You apply intense heat very quickly � you want it just right, just perfect. You want it juicy and pink on the inside, tender as anything, but on the exterior you want some color, maybe a little char. Not crispy, but done right on the outside, while almost not at all on the inside. Tender, but not mushy. Thing is, that moment of perfection is about as long as an avocado�s window of ripeness � it�s like, a minute, maybe less. You cook that steak one minute too long, and you�ve lost it. You don�t cook it enough, and you never get to where you want it. (And by the way, if you�re one of those people who wants a steak well-done, just go and eat a shoe. A burned shoe. Do not waste your money on a good steak by charring it to the consistency of an asbestos roof shingle. You monster.) A perfect steak is a golden moment. Go beyond that moment, and its deliciousness swiftly dwindles toward utter disappointment.



Benefits of Speed Workouts
Speed work leads to better running economy. As your body adapts to the increased pace, your overall mechanics adjust to become more efficient at foot strike and toe off. Also, speed work allows you to improve your overall efficiency when running at race pace.

� Adaptation to quicker paces leads to less energy expended at half- or full marathon race pace.
� Along with improved speed comes a greater margin of error on race day as it relates to race pace. Without the inclusion of speed work in your training schedule, you will not have much flexibility in terms of your race pace because you will have only trained your body to work within a small range.
� We all have a unique muscle makeup, which includes a combination of slow- and fast-twitch muscle fibers. Speed training works the full complement of your muscle makeup, which is important because come race day you will need every available fiber to be fully developed. As slow-twitch fibers fatigue in longer races, fast-twitch muscles are called into action in the later miles of the event.




1. Chunk it.

Marathoners "have to reframe how we think about obstacles," writes Foley. "Rather than thinking about the entire project looming ahead, focus on the fact that it will end--and in the meantime, control smaller parts of it," she instructs.

In the context of running that may mean tamping down your rising panic and instead focusing on simply managing the next mile. In life, that might be putting aside the massiveness of the problem or project you're facing, and just focusing on the next chapter, protest, or task.

2. Expect (and accept) setbacks.

Marathoners know going in that some of the race is going to suck. You should follow their lead whenever you start out on a truly big project.

"It's also important to accept that in any long-term endeavor there will be setbacks along the way. You may develop a cramp that slows you down, miss a deadline, or simply fail to achieve a short-term goal altogether due to forces beyond your control. In these moments, you can't let your disappointment in one small failure break down your entire endeavor," explains Foley.


When I run, all those doubts disappear and I feel better, I feel that I'm better. . That no matter how shitty I feel, how many flaws I might have (bad breathing, stride, cadence...) I know that I'll make it to the end and feel proud of myself. And finally, for one short moment, I feel capable enough to overcome all those self-imposed limitations.  Running makes me feel strong, fast, and accomplished. It's also a source of sanity in a somewhat meh period of life. I got into running about 6 months ago - at 35. Before then, I always had this misconception that runners had their shit together because they are in good shape and can do some pretty incredible things, physically. I have realized the opposite is true - many of us run because we absolutely do not have our shit together. My personal life is a bit of a mess right now, but dammit, I can run further and faster than I ever have before. And that, I can control. So that on Sunday night, after finishing my long run, when my friends and I get together for game night, I can eat a whole god-damned pizza and feel like a hero. A Pizza Hero.



I don�t believe in shortcuts. One appeal of long-distance racing is that there is no way of faking fitness. A runner may be lucky to get good weather or may have chosen a flat, fast course, but he or she still has to run for one or more hours. Any runner who attempts a long distance race without properly preparing courts disaster.

Worse still, this failure can�t be hidden. On race day, it becomes clear who did their homework and who didn�t. Hitting the wall is no myth; it�s a real physiological event that occurs when the body runs through its glycogen stores. Glycogen is the body�s preferred source of fuel�it burns cleanly and is readily available as blood sugar. The body stores about a two-hour supply of glycogen in the liver, more than enough for most of its needs.

Problems arise, however, when we ask our body to work harder than we�ve trained it to do, especially over long periods of time. When we eat through our available glycogen stores, we experience a sudden drop in energy. It�s as if our power cords were just cut or we suddenly were running through cement. The loss of energy can come on suddenly, like a car running out of gas.

That�s hitting the wall.

A runner who hits the wall suddenly slows from a run to a shuffle or even a walk. It�s a very public declaration that the runner didn�t prepare for the kind of race she or he was trying to run.

Hitting the wall isn�t inevitable, however. Long runs done in training trigger an adaptation response in the body, forcing it to rely increasingly on fat for fuel instead of just glycogen.






about running, weight lifting and the discipline needed to constantly challenge our �comfort zones�. We talked for a few minutes and it got me to start looking into the deeper reasons why it�s so important to me. Questioning things like: Why do I get up early to exercise? Why run day after day on the trails? Is all of this time being spent on exercise selfish and worth the sacrifice?

At first, it was exciting to start running long distances on new trails and to lift heavy weight that I thought was impossible. It�s exciting because the experience of accomplishing something so �BIG�, is a shot of an adrenaline that I deeply crave. It�s especially rewarding after putting in the time and pain needed to get there. It puts me in a great mood and gives me the self-confidence to do other things that I may think is a bit of reach�even for me. However, once I knew I could run very long distances and lift heavy weights, working out has lost some of it�s gleam. I�ve been having real trouble lately running the distances I did two years ago, because I simply know I can do it. Recently, I started racing my own times around the many �home trails� I skip around to from day to day. There are no spectators, or other racers with me. It�s just me and the trail� while I try to beat my last PR (previous record) there. Even though this type of running on the trails is tough, it often leaves me with a feeling of inconsistent fulfillment... often questioning what I�m actually trying to accomplish.



And that�s why I run.

Not because it�s cool
Not because I can buy cool running gear
Not because I can brag about it
Not because others run
Not because it�s healthy
I run because I need it. It�s more about self-awareness, focus, and productivity than it is about fitness.

When I run, I don�t think about anything else. I only focus on breathing through my nose, the way I land my feet, how fast I run, and how my body feels. And at the same time, I try to enjoy the outdoors too.



Train for 50k. Smash all your old PRs. 

5k

First half: Don't be an idiot.

Second half: Don't be a wuss.


I remember some coach saying the marathon is a 20 mile jog to the start line

I now see outdoor walking as an essential nutrient; it shouldn�t require an excuse. What we need to excuse ourselves from is the kind of perverse, post-industrial arrangement where it is even possible to spend a whole day without traveling any significant distance outside on foot.

Fresh air and bodily movement are always healthy, of course, but to get the full, disproportionately worthwhile benefits of neighborhood walking, it is essential that you don�t know where you�re going. If you have a destination, or even a regular walking route, then you risk making the walking itself into a task: something to be done with, rather than something to do.

When I step out of the building, I don�t know if I�m going to turn left or right until I�m doing it. I�ve gone on hundreds of these destinationless walks, and a regular route has not emerged. It turns out my body knows how to create a closed polygon without my mind having to think about it.

There�s something life-affirming about any enterprise in which you rely on moment-to-moment intuition instead of planning�and it�s just a walk, so you can�t muck anything up too badly. At every corner, you just turn whichever way you feel like, or maybe continue straight ahead. Let your feet decide. You will end up at home, somehow.


Suddenly she was running more miles than ever, and on top of that, building workouts inside her long runs. This was uncharted territory, but the payoff was huge. Heading into the track season, she felt stronger than ever.

�The last 100 meters of that race is something I will remember to the end,� Goodman says. �It was a lot of validation of years and years of hard work, and work that wasn�t always translating into the results I wanted. Stanford is no Olympic stadium, but man, it felt like one.�

It�s one thing to dream of that momentous breakthrough�and another to create it. At some point you need to ask: What elements are missing from your training? What bad habits have you let sneak in? What have you resisted changing in your lifestyle?

Increasing your mileage comes with a host of benefits: increased capillary density, greater numbers of mitochondria, better usage of fat as fuel while running fast, muscle fiber adaptations, and higher glycogen storage. These cellular-level changes allow you to maintain a desired pace for a longer time by making your body more efficient with oxygen usage and energy production.

Run joyfully.� It is Goodman�s mantra, her website�s name, and what she tries to personify when she opens the door every morning to put in her miles. What does running joyfully entail?

�One, it�s really living off those endorphins,� she says. �I mean, how many runs do you ever regret going on? Nine out of 10 times, you feel better, happier, and have a clearer head for having spent a few minutes out in nature�or the urban jungle. The other half comes from a place of gratitude. Just appreciate the opportunity that you have to be out there.�

There are going to be some terrible times when you run 50 miles in a day or 120 miles in a week,� he says. �But what I chose to remember later�and what I chose to remember in the moment�was, �Holy crap, this is an amazing gift that I have a body that can do this. I�m in the middle of the Rocky Mountains with no one around, experiencing Colorado in a way that very few people get to.� And when you hold on to those notions while running, you�re just happier.�

That doesn�t mean every mile will be wonderful, Goodman says. But if you take a moment, even in the middle of a raging nor�easter or a tough workout, to remind yourself how fortunate you are to be running in the first place, then you�re more likely to appreciate the process.

�We don�t have the power to change an experience�an experience is what it is,� Catalano says. �But we do have the power to change how we experience that experience. You can let those dark voices [in your head] overwhelm you and have a bad day, or you can make the voices focus on all the good stuff, and it turns out to be a pretty amazing day. And the thing is, it�s the same damn day.�

Change this: Enjoy running for running�s sake, not just for its outcomes.

Why: A happy, positive runner performs better and feels more satisfaction.





Not every race is perfect, not every race is enjoyable, but they all teach me something, which is what makes them real.

For many, pushing the line between thrill and danger is exactly the point.

�The mind, the mental anguish, is actually even harder than the physical,� said Karl Hoagland, the publisher of Ultrarunning Magazine. �With every ounce of your energy and your being, you want it to be over and to stop in the worst, most primal way. We�re programmed for survival, for the mind to shut the body down when we�re on empty, so you have to overcome that. Ultra runners are trained to get their body closer to empty.�

The uninitiated may question the wisdom of disregarding mental cues that promote survival.

�Maybe it is really unhealthy, but for me, I�m curious,� Hoagland said. �I only live once, and I want to see what it�s like to go to these dark places, where we�re not intended to be. At his or her core, an ultra runner is meant to go beyond what is rational. It�s crazy, but that�s how we are.�

Roche said the events were a chance to explore limits on one�s own terms � like a dress rehearsal for real adversity.

�Life now is pretty sterile � a lot of the problems we face are manufactured,� Roche said. �When things go wrong in ultras, it�s very real and visceral, and you confront it. It�s life condensed down to a bite-size morsel that you can generally consume without consequence. If you don�t finish, it doesn�t actually matter.�




running tips:

1. Unfortunately there is no big secret. Breakthroughs happen when you consistently put in uninterrupted work day after day. Have a plan that sets you up to hit your goals. As you work through the training runs and workout sessions, you�ll gain fitness and confidence that you�re prepared for the big race . But don�t be a slave to what�s on the page and be sure to listen to your body. Staying healthy is key. Listen to your body and learn what pain to push through and when your body is telling you it needs rest and recovery. Trust your training. Even if you didn�t hit every workout, your plan should be building your fitness. Running is a process so you may not see all your gains immediately or all at once, but keep putting in the work. It will pay off down the line.

2. Take risks�calculated and safe risks, of course. Take a leap of faith. Take a chance. Run an extra few miles. Go with a faster competitor in a race. Run a different distance

running - it all comes down to commitment, hard work, perseverance, passion .. have courage to test yourself from time to time, you never know how things might turn out or whom you might inspire

There is no instant gratification. You have to work for it. Sweat for it. Give up sleeping in on Sundays 


So most runners, whether they aim for finish lines or personal-best finish times, are really after the same thing. But merely reaching the finish line only scratches the itch as long as it remains challenging. When you get to the point where completing the race is no big deal, you almost have to become a PR-seeker to continue earning that wonderful feeling of satisfaction you can only get from walking through the finish chute thinking, I ran absolutely as hard as I could. I faced the pain and the doubt and I did not back down one inch.



Four weeks into the streak I had hit a rhythm. You do almost anything every day for four weeks and you start to get good at it. I no longer got tired on a run. I found out legs don't hurt on days off when you never take a day off. You never feel guilty about the run you don't take when you take them all. You don't have favorite running clothes�you have whatever is clean and whatever works, which is whatever you happen to grab when you reach into the drawer. Individual runs are not important, but running as a whole feels more so. One morning I completed a long run without ever breathing faster than a resting pace. Once I came home after an exceptionally cold run and looked in the mirror at the icicles on my eyelashes and thought, I am officially as crazy a runner as anyone I've ever made fun of. Then I took a hot shower and dressed up and looped a belt around my waist and hooked the buckle on the smallest hole�a new hole on a belt I've had for more than 10 years.





The R2R2R has been something I�ve talked about for a long time now. It was so special to be able to set aside a specific training block to focus on this and have it all come together. I went in not knowing if I could do it or even if I could get close to Rob Krar�s record. I couldn�t have asked the Canyon to give me a better day to go for this record. It blows me away how everything seemed to come together so delicately and perfect. I�m so thankful for everyone who came and supported me for this record attempt, good or bad, and believed in me and continues to believe in what I can do. I want to approach more and more of what I do with the mentality, �Run without limits.� To me, this means to not be afraid to do what�s never been done before. To block out naysayers and embrace the believers. To follow your heart and trust in the training you�ve put in. Trust in your abilities and shoot for the moon. In �The Pursuit of Happyness,� I love the scene when Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is telling his son, �Don�t ever let someone tell you, you can�t do something. Not even me. You got a dream, you got to protect it. People can�t do something themselves, they want to tell you, you can�t do it. You want something, go get it. Period.� Embrace the people who believe in you, surround yourself with positivity, and go get it!




Lastly, this is an opportunity to recognize that I am capable of dealing with any series of setbacks if I just keep moving. One day at a time, and even one step at a time. To take from RMR�s own Julia German in her memorable wedding speech, life is a lot like a 100 mile race. There will be times where you question what the hell you�re suffering for, but you keep moving anyway. Sometimes it�s for no other reason than not knowing what to do otherwise. But when the sunrises, or you reach an aid station (or get a new job, a new home and have found a wonderful community) it�s easy to realize what you�ve been moving for. Whether it is a finish line or financial stability, that hardship makes whatever accomplishment so much more worthwhile.



Then I wonder why do we do anything,� Stapanowich said in a moment of reflection on Monday night. �I guess I just enjoy imposing challenges on my mind and body and the feeling of achievement when they work together to overcome a difficult situation. When the adversity is self-imposed, it often teaches me lessons that are applicable in other scenarios of my life where I feel like I have less control. I think for this Pikes Peak Quad trip, the lessons have been about choice and the experience of pain without suffering.�




And so I practiced it in my training. Climbing up Longs Ranch Road on tired legs and a body on the verge of a massive bonk. Look up, admire the beauty of the forest, and savor the moment�

�Be joyful though you have considered the facts.�

Kneeling by the creek and dousing myself in its icy-cold waters because it�s about all I could do to try to revive myself after running out of calories and bonking hard on the way back from Mount Rosa. Savor the moment. Embrace the pain, the challenge, and the thrill that it brings�



Once I read up on what I was supposed to be doing, and why, all of which is so nicely summed up in this article, I changed my training, and all of a sudden everything came together so much nicer.

I enjoyed my runs more.

I was able to run more frequently.

I was able to add miles on a week by week basis.

I was able to stretch from a 10k long run that killed me, to a 20k long run in the morning that left me ready to face the rest of the day.

Running by feel was exactly the wrong way for me to start, because I started with the assumtion that pushing myself harder would give me better results.

Running slow was very effective for me a couple of years ago. I started out rather fit but not in any kind of running shape and wanted to run an ultra marathon in about 5 months. I knew I needed a lot of miles and didn't want to get hurt so I started training religiously with a heart rate monitor and very strictly kept under a HR that was excruciatingly slow. Often times I would have to walk up minor hills to keep my HR under that number, was often passed by people who were clearly just getting started in running, it sucked. Every run my pace at that heart rate got a little faster, not fast mind you, but faster. Eventually I got to a pace that was enjoyable and really learned a lot about pacing.

I jumped from running once a month directly into 30+ mile weeks, topping out around 50 without getting injured. Keep in mind that while the mileage wasn't extraordinarily high, it was all at a really slow pace so it was a ton of time spent running. I did get a few chronic pains but nothing that turned into an injury and they went away as soon as I started tapering.

A few months into it and I ran a half marathon much much faster than I expected, then set a PR in the marathon a month later (I'd run two in my life, PR was when I was a teenager and the last one was over a decade ago). The ultra went absolutely perfect and I attribute a lot of that to how much I learned about pacing. I was most surprised at how much speed I was picking up though, with virtually no intensity I was able to hit times in races that were approaching my high school XC times.



When you run hard, lactate accumulates in your muscles and other markers of fatigue set in, making you less efficient for the immediate future. While this study and plenty of anecdotal evidence make the case for moderating pace in the early stages of the run, especially for longer races, athletes still frequently get swept up in the excitement of race day, burning through vital energy stores too early.



TIPS:

1. Slow down
2. Stay hydrated all the time, drink water all day .. now i can run 10miles without any water
3. Sleep, rest
4. Enjoy your runs
5. Book a race!



My first day out at the track I wanted to see if I could do a simple 3 miles just to get an idea of where I stood. I put in a solid hard effort and did 3 miles in 30 minutes. I was very happy about my result as at any other point in my life it would have been impossible.

After that day I got out there and ran as much as I could, mostly 3-4 times a week. Every time I ran I kept pushing myself as hard as I could. I would run every run with the intention of beating my previous one. You can see where this is going right? First it was the IT Band, then the Achilles, then the top of my foot, and finally my hips. I thought that at 26 I would be fine upping myself to 20 miles a week and giving 100% effort on every run. I was completely wrong. I went to a PT and did foam roller exercises and mrytl routines every day, sometimes spending an hour a day just making sure I did everything possible to help my injuries. Even through all of this I was still constantly pushing myself too hard. Everything I read said to do most of your miles 2 minutes slower than your endurance pace etc etc and I thought that was way too slow. Eventually I decided to listen and picked out a plan for my upcoming half marathon. It would be my first half marathon and I wanted it to count. I used one of the Hal Higdon plans and followed it to a T while also making sure to stay consistent and not push my pace too much.

Suddenly everything was perfect. I no longer needed PT or to even foam roll. I still do occasionally foam roll when I feel certain levels of tightness but it is rare compared to my old 30 minute routine. The myrtl routine and core work has stuck though as that is 100% necessary for my body to stay healthy at this point. So if you needed another person to listen to, you have found it. SLOW THE FUCK DOWN!

The best tips I have found on this sub so far are:


It�s not just me, and it�s not just running. Ask anyone whose day regularly includes a hard bike ride, sprints in the pool, a complex problem on the climbing wall, or a progressive powerlifting circuit, and they�ll likely tell you the same: A difficult conversation just doesn�t seem so difficult anymore. A tight deadline not so intimidating. Relationship problems not so problematic.


Exercise isn�t just about helping out your health down the road, and it�s certainly not just about vanity. What you do in the gym (or on the roads, in the ocean, etc.) makes you a better, higher-performing person outside of it. The truth, clich� as it may sound, is this: When you develop physical fitness, you�re developing life fitness, too.


Simply training for your first half marathon or CrossFit competition can also yield huge dividends that carry over into other areas of life.


While the traditional benefits of vigorous exercise � like prevention and treatment of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and osteoporosis � are well known and often reported, the most powerful benefit might be the lesson that my coach imparted to me: In a world where comfort is king, arduous physical activity provides a rare opportunity to practice suffering.


When Bauhs starts overthinking and worrying, races tend to be a little bit tougher, he says. When he goes into a race very relaxed, it's a completely different � and much smoother � experience. In the most physically and mentally challenging moments of a marathon, he's trying to stay relaxed and always remembering one very important thing � how grateful he is to be doing what he loves.


"From the very first race that I've ever run, I've been doing this for fun," he says. "I've been blessed to take it pretty far, but still, the point in doing this is because it's fun. So, I just try to stay relaxed and appreciate being able to run these races."

"I've never gone out too slow in a race before, but I've certainly gone out too fast many, many times," Bauhs says.

Runners can often make up a lot of ground in the last 8 to 10 miles of a race if they're feeling good, he explains, stressing the importance of staying relaxed and being patient through the beginning of a race.

"You want to run an aggressive pace at the beginning if you can, but it's a lot better to finish hard than it is to start hard and finish at a much slower pace."


doesn't get easier, you just get used to it.


You don't want to wait until you're 80 to see this shit.


This is what I said to Shacky at one of the summits. The beauty of these trails, the quality of the climbs, and the scenery from the single track were all spectacular. Shacky�s favorite was Stage 5 where we realized how grateful we were to be able to experience all this while we were still young and able-bodied.

I loved Stage 4 where during a brutal climb the runners behind me were bitching loudly. Although my legs were stinging and lungs were burning, all I could think of was how much I love this.

Don�t wait to retire to see the world. Take vacations. Downgrade your life. Cut your expenses to get out and see these things. The views are free, you just have to get your ass there. You won�t regret it or forget it.


In the shuttle to the packet pick up, we chatted with the volunteer driver who was local and accustomed to living and running at elevation. He mentioned that we shouldn�t be too concerned with the elevation. The truth is that everybody pants while running. Everyone feels like there�s less air. People who run there are just used to it.

This is true for mountain running as well. Running up a mountain is always hard. Running down is always technical and rocky. But the more you do it, the more familiar your body feels with the difficulty of it. It doesn�t get easier, you just get used to it. This knowledge allowed me to feel less disadvantaged and more competitive.


When I run, it�s the highlight of my day. I�m out in nature listening to the chirping of the birds, the rustling of the leaves on the trees, and the synchronization of my footfalls and breathing. I�m alone, in solitude. Just me and my thoughts as I move the way my body evolved to move. Past regrets and future concerns disappear as I focus on that next step, that next hill or descent, right here, right now.

But I had no idea that running could be like this. I thought it was just something people did to manage their weight, and it was only after I discovered the joy in cycling that I was able to return to running with a new perspective.

But that�s the problem. Our society fundamentally misunderstands the role of exercise. We believe that it�s a drudgerous, self-flagellating activity to be endured in order to get that �beach body� or stay healthy. The idea that it can be fun, that it can be something more than struggle and exertion�it�s conspicuously absent from the mainstream narrative.

Just look at the design of our gyms. Why are there so many televisions? Most of the machines in the cardio rooms are pointed right at them and have little headphone ports so you can zone out. The idea is that exercise can�t possibly be enjoyable enough in-and-of itself.


Alan Watts described this situation perfectly:

It is a very nice thing to run and go dancing across the hills at a fast speed, but we see these joggers shaking their bones, rattling their brains, and running on their heels. There is a grimness about it because it is so determinately good for you.

I see this all the time at Gray�s Lake in Des Moines: new runners pounding the ground with a low cadence, grunting as they battle fatigue and shortness of breath. Headphones jammed into their ears and cords dangling in the breeze.

�This is good for me, this is good for me, this is good for me,� I imagine them saying.

But they look miserable.

Dr. Yoni Freedhoff often says that we need to rebrand exercise. As mentioned on his blog, Weighty Matters:

We didn�t evolve to sit at desks and stand behind counters, to shut ourselves in tiny boxes and miss the best hours of the day while we complete arduous tasks. We evolved to move. When I�m out running on a beautiful trail or country road, I�m a part of nature like every other animal. I put on my sunglasses, take in the beautiful and slightly tinted world around me, and depart on my own personal adventure. It makes me feel alive. I�m moving. Running. Going from Point A to Point B with an ability and urge that�s deeply embedded in my DNA and only needs to be unearthed, rediscovered, and released.

For the late Dr. George Sheehan, running was a form of play. A way to escape the trappings of modern life and recapture a childlike sense of joy. According to his son, Andrew, it �stripped from [his life] the complicating need for possessions and position��which, for many of us, is a significant cause of stress.

As Dr. Sheehan wrote:

Today�s work does not make us the persons we can be. Work is simply the price to be paid. Having earned our daily bread, we can turn to our daily play.

Watch a group of children on a playground sometime, and you�ll notice one thing: they like to run. They don�t ask for permission, require specialized shoes and brightly-colored clothing, and they don�t warm up and do their stretches.

They just run.

They see it as an equally-valid method of getting from Point A to Point B as walking. Perhaps more so. They smile, saunter about, and sometimes leap with excitement. They race each other�challenging friends by saying �one, two, three, go!�



There�s only one problem: running is hard.

As one runner friend said to me, in the first few minutes of a run, your body enters a period of shock, essentially saying, what the heck are you doing to me? To run is all about hitting that wall and pushing through it. And then doing that over and over again.


Racing a marathon takes a healthy dose of patience, but it also requires guts. You have to be gutsy to push the pace, trusting your training to take you to the finish. You can�t run scared. You have to believe that you have all the business in the world running the paces you�ve trained to run. You have to believe you belong there.

Running is a punishing sport. In training and racing we beat on our bodies, and�let�s be honest�in a masochistic sort of way, competitive runners enjoy the thrill of kicking their own butts to the point of being completely spent when there�s a personal best at stake.

For Ritzenhein it�s worth taking risks to get a true, one-hundred percent performance out of himself; he could back off more for the sake of being cautious, but that 10% margin of loss wouldn�t grant him a reflection of all he was truly capable of achieving.

By backing off ten percent perhaps one would be injured less�or, you could gamble, go all in and wind up with the race of your life. It�s like walking on the edge of a cliff. Sometimes you fall off and wind up injured, other times you don�t and you wind up with the performance of a lifetime�like Ritzenhein did when he broke the American Record in the 5,000 meters two summers ago.


Wading in chest-high water that�s an eye-opening 60 degrees. Sleeping in a mosquito-netted hammock in the humid jungle. Scraping my hands while scaling ragged karst. Hoping I don�t lose my footing on a small, uneven rock ledge many feet above the valley floor below. The occasional bat flying past my face. This hardly sounds like a luxury vacation.

And by most definitions, exploring the Phong Nha caves in Vietnam is not a luxury vacation. But as more of us are chasing the new luxuries of one-of-a-kind experiences, nudging our boundaries so we learn we�re capable of more than we thought, going places few others go and just generally feeling like a badass, the experience fits the bill. (I like to joke that everything fun requires a waiver. This expedition reminded me that many fun things also require a helmet.)

realize what a great privelege it is to have a body that can finish a marathon, to cross that finish line knowing i gave it everything i had

race with confidence, passionate, but is smart, humbled.

Also I really like that crazy exhausted feeling when you�re totally calorie-depleted and your lungs are on fire and all you want to do is nap.

�It's not family, not curing cancer, not feeding the world, it's running around in circles. I think too often pro athletes can lose perspective and forget what is really important in life

 Running makes us feel alive. It pushes our limits.
Running captured my heart in 1998 � and it still holds it firmly in its grasp more than 16 years later.

So for me, running is now a way of life.  I wake up exceptionally early (no . . . earlier than that) to get my run on.  I do it because I love it.  I miss it when I don't.  It's a huge part of my life and it will be until I can't run any more.

As my running career matured, my thoughts on how to run faster, prevent overuse injuries, and truly enjoy running have changed as well.

When I first joined my high school�s cross country team, I only thought about running while I was at practice or a race. Running was simply something I did after school.


Why do I run?
What has running meant to me

I've found that running was a way for me to 

because it is hard
to see what I am capable of

natural, so simple .. just throw some shoes and shorts in a bag and go for it .. literally anyone can do it .. appealing because i could do it anywhere, anytime

i feel like it gives me so much strength, confidence


"There are no shortcuts to any place worth going." �Beverly Sills

here are many days that I just want to stop in the middle of my run and go back home. It will be easy and painless.



Also consider how insignificant the pain is when compared to the feelings of regret you'll feel if you give up.

Sometimes you don't know that you can do something until you do it. But once you've done it before, it suddenly seems very much within reach.


At the end of the fondo I knew cycling is not about looking outward at those ahead or behind you, but inward. It's about discovering the depths of your physical toughness, and learning that your mental toughness runs just a little bit deeper than you imagined. It's not about being better than others, but being, for a few enchanting hours, better than yourself.

I run because it�s so symbolic of life. You have to drive yourself to overcome the obstacles. You might feel that you can�t. You can".

Here�s what I do instead: I see sticking to my plan as the reward itself. Going on a run isn�t the thing I have to get through to get a reward � the run is the reward.

�A lot of my decisions are based on that,� she said. �I�m really picky about what I do because I want it be memorable and impactful. I feel like there are only so marathons within your body and they have to be meaningful.�


These first few runs back from injury bordered on religious experiences. I realized what a profound impact running has had on my life and that it would always be a part of me. Running connects me with nature, my church. It gives my life structure and meaning, things that are essential for happiness. Running enhances every moment of life; it makes food taste better, it makes a cold beer more delicious, it even makes sleep more enjoyable.

Soon, however, I found myself restless and sinking back into melancholy. I realized that, yes, I had endless free time now, but I lacked structure and purpose in my life, the two things that running had given me for the previous 15 years.


If you believe that, I've got something I'd like to sell you too. There's a reason trends like these don't last. In endurance sports, there are no quick fixes. Training to get faster is hard as hell for a reason. If it were easy, you wouldn't get satisfaction from your achievements. It's hard to wake up in the morning and head out for a run when you're dead tired. It's hard to make yourself go outside and run in the rain, in the cold or after a long, ruthless day at work. It takes sacrifice, willingness to suffer and plenty of determination. You can't get that in any store in any country, and that's what makes running so special.



All in all, it was an incredible experience. By the time I finished, it was a really powerful experience. I don't mean to sound hyperbolic, but it really did change my life. I'm not the kind of person who ever, five years ago, would've dreamed of doing something like this. The sense of accomplishment was just overwhelming. It made me realize anything is possible. We often end up on these long tours, when we're away from home, playing shows, doing press, getting sick, missing people back home--wives, or kids for some of us. I started to look at what I do for a living through the lens of doing a marathon. The marathon was the most difficult thing I've done in my life. To get through that, it made me realize I can get through anything. It really did shift something in my brain, flipped a switch I didn't even realize was there. Whenever someone I know says, "I could never do that." I think: That's exactly what I thought! It proves anyone can do it.

I'll go on long runs and pray for people. I remind myself daily to be thankful for the ability to run. Every day that I get to run is a gift.

You can literally run anywhere. If you have a pair of decent shoes, you can get out there and go running. You don't necessarily need a gym, and you don't need anybody else. You don't need a trainer. You don't need anything. You can just up and do it.

As my heart pounds from the adrenaline pumping through my veins, I stop and tell myself, "Dude, it�s just running." I try to trivialize what I�m about to do to take some of the pressure off myself. "You�re not feeding starving children, you�re not curing cancer, you�re literally moving around in circles," I repeat in my head. The plus side of this technique is that it works well for me. The negative is that when I do perform well, it takes time for the meaning of what I�ve accomplished to settle in.

Running transform from something I had to do to something I wanted to do. I looked forward to my Friday afternoon ritual of mapping out the 4 to 10 miles I planned to run the next day.

accounts of last race, devotes entire weekend mornings to runs, and describes fueling and pacing strategies to anyone who will listen.

3. Buy two pairs of shoes

The miles will add up over the course of three months of half-marathon training, and one pair of shoes likely won�t be enough to handle the entire load. Having two fresh pairs of shoes on hand when you start your training helps extend the life of each pair by giving them ample recovery time between workouts. Just as your body needs to recover after a long run or key workout, so do your kicks. Recent studies suggest that alternating between a couple different pairs of shoes in training can decrease running-related injury risk by varying the load to your musculoskeletal system. Buying two pair of shoes can be an expensive outlay in cash, but the return on your investment can be extraordinary. Consider it an investment in your health and your ultimate race goals for the year.

I�ve thought a lot about the marathon since March, and in reflection, I�ve come to realize the marathon wasn�t the biggest accomplishment. Yea, yea, I�m part of the 1 percent now, or so I�m told. But truth be told, the magic of a marathon isn�t in the 26.2 miles on race day; it�s in the nearly 500 miles of training that happens in the months before. It was the conversations with Tim that laid a foundation of trust for our friendship. It�s the thoughtfulness that Sharon showed those times she had chocolate milk at the end of our long runs. It�s the overwhelming generosity Rebecca showed me, from giving me her rain jacket after hearing about me freezing without one, to running my first 15 miler with me, taking me out to breakfast afterward, and everything in between (she really is too good to be true). It�s the amazing sense of love I felt when I saw my friends wearing �Team Stacy� t-shirts at the finish line. And, it�s in the countless feelings, frustrations, and fears I have worked through while running down those desolate, tree-lined roads. You see, I wasn�t supposed to be a runner. But I am. And my life is better because I chose to be a one.


For the more advanced runner who wants to have a good race and is a bit nervous about the distance, a simple plan of 1 mile comfortable, 4 miles steady, then 1.2 miles fast is a great way to run the distance. This plan assumes that you've run a 10K before. The first mile of this plan is really important, as so many runners go out too fast in the first five minutes of a race, and pay dearly for it at the end of the race as they suffer through the final miles.

Running a negative-split race is so important in the 10K. It shows that you understand how to persevere when you get really uncomfortable. You don't want to run a positive-split race, where you run fast for 4 miles, but slow a bit in mile 5, and then have a miserable mile 6.


However, I would like to add something about the actual race pacing strategy that has worked well for me and my milers. Aim for an even EFFORT throughout the race by running a slightly uneven pace as follows: 

Here is a one mile (1600M) example.

Lap 1 -  Use your adrenaline to run the lst lap 2-3 seconds faster than goal pace. The nervous energy will allow this faster pace while keeping the effort even.

Lap 2 - Now run the second lap at goal pace arriving at the 800 still a couple of seconds ahead of pace.

Lap 3 - Concentrate on not letting the pace slip away knowing that the effort is now going to seem greater than the first two laps, but expect that the pace will slow a bit. You will start to feel a bit sorry for yourself because you have committed to feel such pain of fatigue and you will probably tell yourself that you need to save something for your kick. If so, expect to slow down at couple of seconds off goal pace. But now you will start the last lap exactly on goal pace. 

Lap 4 - According to your strength as a runner (speed or endurance), start kicking all-out at the appropriate point of the last lap. 

In the 13 seconds that it took me to close that final 100 meters I allowed myself to really enjoy the moment. Instead of the usual race thoughts like, "How are my legs? Am I in the right position? Is the pace too fast? Too slow?" I was able to quiet my mind and just glide. The only thought I remember having was, "I am so lucky to be here, I hope my life is filled with many more moments just like this." Granted, 13 seconds is a blink of an eye in a lifetime of emotions, but I can assure you I have felt this way many times before while running.




Start slow. No matter how far or how long you plan to go, start out slowly to warm up and gradually raise your heart rate. That will make the workout feel easier sooner. You want to go into the workout with the idea that you�ll finish strong. If you finish feeling gassed, you�re going to be demoralized and it�s going to be that much more difficult to get out for your next workout. One of the most common mistakes newer runners make is going out too fast.

Most runners, says Solkin, are "chest breathers"-not "belly breathers." To help her clients see the difference, she has them run a mile at a pace that gets them huffing a bit. Then she has them stop and place one hand on their abdomen and one hand on their chest and watch. The lower hand should move with each breath, while the upper hand should remain relatively still (usually the opposite occurs). "Every time you breathe in, your belly should fill up like a balloon," says Solkin (see "Breathe Right"). "And every time you breathe out, that balloon should deflate. When you chest breathe, your shoulders get tense and move up and down. That's wasted energy-energy you should conserve for running."


Stick to the basics:
� Increase your cadence to roughly 170-180 steps per minute. 
� Land with your foot underneath your body, as opposed to �reaching� out with your foot and overstriding.

These two adjustments will solve the vast majority of bad running form issues!

� Keep your back tall with a slight forward lean. No slouching or leaning from the waist.
� Try to land on your midfoot, though a slight heel strike (I�m a moderate heel.mid-foot striker myself) or �proprioceptive heel strike� isn�t necessarily bad
� Keep your arms at a roughly 90 degree angle (though this will vary) and try not to swing them across your chest.

Running is thought to be a simple exercise. You go out and put one foot in front of the other and the more rapidly you do it the faster you�ll go. That is exactly what running is but how to run efficiently and with minimal injury is another story. Just simply putting one foot down and then the next is not the best way to run. If you looked at most, if not all, the Olympic runners you will see that they all have very similar form. They are running upright with a semi forward lean and they are not over extending their legs. Their feet land under their body and they seem to glide across the ground. There are numerous names for the techniques that people use; there is the Pose method, Chi method, Evolution method and Good Form Running. They all have the same basic concepts with very few minor variations.

The first thing that needs work when learning how to run better is your posture. The different forms give slightly different variations on posture. A good running posture is one that is upright and with your shoulders back. This is to allow your lungs to fully inflate with each breath. The get a good posture simply raise your hands above your head and take a deep breath. Now slowly lower your arms to your sides and keep the chest up and shoulders back. This is something that can be done before you run and every so often while you are running.

The next step in running properly and with good running form is a good forward lean. Now a 
forward lean is something that isn�t really natural while you are running. A lot of people that run actually have a reverse lean and that slows you down significantly. The forward lean should come from the ankles because if you remember we have our good upright posture. The back and hips should be straight while you lean. This will cause you to have a slight fall which is using gravity to propel you forward instead of your legs. All your legs are doing is stopping you form hitting the ground.


The third part about running properly is cadence. Cadence is how many times you feet hit the ground. In the military they count cadence every time the left foot hits the ground. The cadence that is said to be the most effective is 180 steps per minute or 90 steps per foot. This may seem quick at first and if you are not at 180/min don�t worry just slowly work your way up to 180/min over time.

Running Technique

The final step on how to run properly is foot strike. This is where a lot of the methods differ. Some
say forefoot, some say mid-foot but all agree that a heal strike is bad. A heal strike is obviously when your heal strikes the ground first, this slows you slightly. A forefoot and mid-foot strike when combined with a 180/min cadence will cause you foot to land under your hips and therefore not slowing you down. This is where the Olympians get that glide look while they are running.



Be flexible

On the perfect day, running a marathon is all about pacing. On a less than perfect day, it�s all about adjusting your strategy based on whatever the day throws your way. That means being adaptable to environmental conditions, hot and sunny or cool and rainy, the route and the crowd around you.

It also means listening and adapting to what your body is telling you, be it a bout of tummy trouble, muscle cramps, blisters or chafing. It�s the marathon, and how well you manage those challenges can be the difference between smiling for the camera as you cross the finish line or grabbing a bus toward an early exit.

The best way to deal with race-day challenges is to modify your goals and strategy before you�re forced to. Adjust




Summary
To recap about running form and how to run properly there are four main techniques that everyone agrees helps to run better.

Posture, forward lean, cadence and foot strike are the four main elements to running form. 

So if you want to be healthy and stay injury free then changing to a less impactful running form is for you. How to run properly is very hard and can take a long time to transition to so don�t get discouraged if it doesn�t work out the first time or the tenth time just think about how to run with the proper form and practice.

You can improve your running technique and become stronger as a runner quickly and easily using the proven methods in this class and with the individualized training program we will be developing for you.

For running does involve sacrifices. In the ever increasing hecticness (or hecticity, you choose) of everyday life, finding time to get those treasured miles in is no easy feat.  Getting up at unearthly hours in the morning whilst others are enjoying an extra hour in bed; dragging ourselves out on a cold evening after a hard day at work; making sure we are not neglecting the other people in our lives, be it babies, children, husbands, wives or parents; Being a runner takes dedication, organisation and more often than not a high degree of time management.

It�s tough work if you want to be fast.  As my old coach used to tell me, �You can�t burn the candle at both ends.�  You have to make a lot of sacrifices in order to fit that mileage into your already busy schedule.  Happy hour on Thursday nights with your friends?  Keep dreaming.  Reaching your full potential takes absolute focus and you have to stay aligned with your goals.

I had never invested so much energy, time, passion, dedication, motivation and pain in anything.

There are no shortcuts in life, now I understand that and the marathon can be used as a life experiment in many ways. I learned a lot about myself �on the run� because you basically have to be with yourself for 6 hours. You have to be patient and now I feel that I can do pretty much anything, I just have to find the right method. This pain must be felt, the alternative, at least in my case, was much worse. That huge amount of pain is what makes this beautiful, what makes it special, what makes it worthy and the reason why you are reading this. The bright side is that this pain is not alone; it is accompanied by something else. It comes with hope and that is where you are once you finish the marathon. I struggled for almost 6 hours somewhere between agony and optimism and I triumphed over adversity. So, I�m human, I bleed, I cry, I feel but I�m also alive, healthy and that is what we have.



Exercise has always been an outlet for me. Whether heading to yoga after a long day at the office or jogging outdoors to unplug from my hyper-connected life, physical activity has always been my go-to method of winding down and re-centering

When I am halfway through my run, I feel like I have all the power in the universe, I feel unstoppable, full of energy and more alive than ever

In the beginning, the snatch will elude you. You�re going to have to get up and keep trying. You�ll spend your time rehearsing your movements and honing your technique; watching countless hours watching Olympic weightlifting videos online; critiquing everyone else�s snatch; maybe making videos of your own. You�ll practice variations on boxes and with bands. You�ll snatch with your broomstick, medicine balls, kettlebells. You�re going to try to front squat and power clean almost double someone�s body weight just to hit a snatch that is barely three-quarters of yours.

But have faith: if you put patience, determination, and diligence into improving all elements of physical fitness, you will be rewarded with a snatch of finesse that brings pride to your efforts. 

If we�re being honest, we can all admit that a marathon is an incredible personal feat. It is a long, hard fought, 26.2 miles of pain, suffering, triumph and joy, all rolled into one. 



you�ve got my attention. This has been nothing short of amazing, and I sincerely hope that you�ll amaze me again.?

It can be hard running slow sometimes (I�m not calling out slow runners�I am a slow runner). I�m referring to that day on your training plan that calls for you to purposefully run slower than you normally would. We�ve all been there. That little box on the calendar reads �5 miles � Easy�. You are capable of so much more than easy. What should you do? Well, you ignore the word easy and blast out those miles pretty close to race pace.

Hey, I get it. It�s hard to slow down when your brain is telling you that the only way to get faster is to run faster on every run. On top of that, a slow run is just junk miles and junk miles are a waste. Plus, you can�t let your friend/neighbor/spouse run faster than you did. No, you need to blast out a PR on every run: training run, race, it doesn�t matter. Run fast!

There are essentially two sources of energy during your run: fats and carbs. As a long distance runner, your primary source of fuel is fat. Don�t worry, even if you are sitting at 5% body fat, there are still plenty of fat deposits to burn. However, once you start increasing your speed, your body stops burning the fat deposits and starts eating up your carbs.  This switch from burning fats to carbs occurs somewhere in the 50-60% range of your VO2 max.  You only have a couple of hours worth of energy in the form of carbs�once those are gone you are done. What was that noise?  That was you hitting the wall.

There is hope. That 50-60% threshold range is right around where your easy runs should be. By keeping those easy runs easy, you are actually training this threshold. Essentially, you are teaching your body to stay in that fat-burning zone longer which may prevent you from hitting that wall.

The most common cause of hitting the wall is muscle glycogen depletion. Glycogen, a fuel derived from dietary carbohydrates, is stored in relatively small amounts in the muscles and liver, where it waits to be delivered to muscles via the bloodstream in the form of glucose. Most runners have enough glycogen in their bodies to run 13.1 miles at a good pace. But the marathon is fundamentally a metabolic challenge. If you run the first half of the race even one percent too fast, you risk depleting your glycogen levels. Finishing a marathon without hitting the wall requires storing and conserving enough glycogen fuel to avoid running out of it somewhere between 20 and 26 miles � which, as the statistics show, is not easy to do.

Good pacing is paramount. You�ll burn through precious glycogen stores more slowly if you maintain a consistent pace than you will if your pace is erratic, even if it averages out to be the same. Proper training also helps. A good marathon training plan will increase your capacity to store glycogen and improve your running economy and fat-burning capacity, enabling you to burn through stores at a slower rate.

Be a Fat-Burning Machine

When running at an anaerobic level, your body relies on glycogen stores in your muscles and liver. During aerobic running, energy is primarily derived from fat stores.

�Most athletes have two to three hours of available glycogen stores,� says Dave Clark, owner and head coach of BMS Multi-Sport in Carbondale, Colorado. Regardless of body type, he says, we all carry fat stores that can fuel more than 100 hours of aerobic activity: �If you can increase your ability to utilize fat for energy, you can go for a much longer period of time without bonking.�

�I used to have to suck down a gel every half hour because my body needed to burn carbs,� says Dannis. �Now I can go for a three-plus-hour run and not need to eat anything. It�s so much easier to have that energy in my legs instead of focused on digesting, and I almost never have stomach issues anymore.�


As is the case in running, you�re going to win and lose several times in life. The key here is to know how to handle success and failure alike. I�ve run races where I didn�t meet my time goal and I�ve gone on runs where I didn�t even come close to my ultimate goal for distance.
Running Rules of Thumb

1. If you see a porta potty with no line, use it. Even if you don't need to.
2. If you have to ask yourself, Does this driver see me? The answer is no.
3. If you have to ask yourself, Are these shorts too short? The answer is yes.
4. 1 glazed doughnut = 2 miles
5. You rarely regret the runs you do; you almost always regret the runs you skip.
6. Not everyone who looks fast really is, and not everyone who looks slow really is.
9. Running any given route in the rain makes you feel 50 percent more hard-core than covering the same route on a sunny day.


Go after your dreams, believe in yourself, never give up. I've toed the line next to runners in their 70s. Sure, we finish at different times, but we went the same distance, we crossed the same finish line, and it was hard. You must have courage to sign up for an ultra distance, and I have unrelenting respect for every single person who ventures to believe that he or she can go the distance. When was the last time you had a chance to stand among a mob of courageous, hopeful, strong individuals?

2. Focus On Your Effort

Jones is a proponent of running timed intervals rather than covering a set distance, which means you�ll need a basic watch (or a coach timing you). �We�re not robots,� Jones says. �We can�t control the speed, pace or distance of the effort every time, so take the stress out of the workout. It doesn�t matter how far you get [in a set amount of time], as long as the effort is the same.�

Jones knows just as the terrain will change, so will the pace of an interval. �The effort to do a specific workout changes every week; the pace for 90 percent effort this week will be different from the pace for 90 percent effort next week,� he said. �So it really doesn�t matter how far you get as long as the effort is consistent.�

Each workout is based on time and effort, not distance � if you�re having a great day, you�ll run farther, but if you�re having a bad day, you�ll cover less distance. Thirty minutes of hard running is 30 minutes of hard running, whether you�re feeling great or feeling horrible. In this way, every workout can be a good workout as long as you�re putting in the right amount of effort.

Run by effort rather than pace. This is the single greatest change a runner can make in the attempt to shed lots of time. Time gets in the way of progress, mentally and physically. Your body doesn�t know time; it knows effort. When you begin to train from within, you�ll be well on your way to setting personal record finishes. Let your time and pace be the outcome of the day�s performance and no more. This allows you to train based on the weather, your body, recovery times, nutrition, sleep, and other stresses that may affect performance. A tempo run isn�t a tempo run because you ran a certain pace; it�s a tempo run when you�re running near or at your redline threshold. Train by the purpose of the workout rather than a proposed pace, and you�ll rock every workout and recovery, every time. Learn how to run a tempo workout perfectly every time.


"The thing about running is that it's work," Siik says. "People say, 'Oh, I hate running. Oh, I hate running.' That's because it's hard. It's one the hardest things. It requires so much energy. You have to use everything � your neck, your shoulders, your arms, your core, your legs. There's no shortcuts. Running is going to be work, and the people that don't avoid that, that don't look for that shortcut, those are the people who can have whatever they want."

I am tired of paying lots of money to run with lots of people and get a really big medal for finishing a race that lots of other people finished. I have more fun at small races with smaller price tags. All that I want from a race is some record of the time it took me to run the it. Anything else is a bonus.
I am tired of showing up two hours before a race, parking a mile away from the start line, having to throw away my warm up clothes, having to walk for a quarter mile at the start of the race, looking at trash surrounding aid stations, and general nonsense associated with being one of thousands of runners. I don't need someone to throw a party for me at the finish line with food trucks and wine and live music.
I understand the fun of it, I am just over it. I signed up for my last race of this variety about 4 months ago, and now I realized my view on running has changed. Yes it is cool that I will be running behind those in the USA Half Marathon championship, but I will never see them, because I am slow, and I am finally starting to admit it.
I just want to run to have a good time. I want to stay in shape. I will be alright if I never PR again for the rest of my life. I want running to be a stress reliever, not something that makes me worry on a day to day basis. I guess I am just trying to chill out with my running and not be so serious about it. I guess I won't be signing up for any more expensive races.
TL;DNR My general outlook on running is shifting, less serious, more chill.







To become the best athlete you can be, you need to become really good at coping with the characteristic forms of discomfort and stress that the endurance sports experience dishes out, beginning with perceived effort and extending to the many challenges that are secondary to it, such as fear of failure. You must discover, practice, and perfect the coping skills that conquer these challenges most effectively. My own term for a highly developed overall coping capacity in endurance sports is mental fitness.

 I would need to learn how to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. I didn�t know it at the time, but that skill, cultivated through running, would help me as much, if not more, off the road as it would on it.





r. Exercise isn�t just about helping out your health down the road, and it�s certainly not just about vanity. What you do in the gym (or on the roads, in the ocean, etc.) makes you a better, higher-performing person outside of it. The truth, clich� as it may sound, is this: When you develop physical fitness, you�re developing life fitness, too.
