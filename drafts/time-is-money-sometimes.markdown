Time Is Money, Sometimes
11-09-2012





You hear the saying everywhere - time is money. I think it's 

Time is worthless

Time is the most valuable thing in the world, and yet by itself it is worthless. Time well used is valuable. 

We all have limited time, and we can’t buy more of it, so philosophically, we might say it’s all priceless. So why do I say it’s worthless? Because unless you spend it well, that time does not have any intrinsic value to your business (though it is probably still worth something to you personally).

I believe and have believed for a while that time is not the right thing to measure or preserve. Buying a $700 computer instead of spending an hour searching for an equivalent $640 computer (the example Jack uses) is a valid trade-off, but not because of the time being saved.

What makes the trade-off valid is the energy, the attention that’s being saved.

We each have a limited amount of attention and energy (two sides of the same coin) to spend on a vast number of potential attention sinks each day. We can only care about so many different things each day, every day, before our very ability to give a damn gives up and we just don’t care anymore and can’t bring ourselves to care.

Spending energy caring about saving $60 on the purchase of a new computer is not worth Jack’s limited supply of energy.

Whenever you’re about to engage in chasing down some rabbit-hole distraction, think of this - if there are only 10 things that you have space to properly care about today, should this be one of them?

Money can buy time

The fact that we are all going to die is certainly depressing, but we do have choices while we’re still here. We can still buy time. Being frugal with the money we earn can mean retiring decades earlier. It can mean turning down overtime and enjoying time with family and friends instead. It can mean not having to take a second job or being able to work part-time. Having money can also allow you to hire people to do the things you don’t want to spend time doing yourself. Being frugal can be the path toward freedom and independence and away from struggle and discontent.

I like my job, but I realize now that every dollar I earn is a moment that I will never get back. Every hour I spend working is time away from the things and people I love. I cannot change this fact, but I can choose to be very frugal with the money that I earn. And at this point in my life, each dollar I earn is literally paid for with moments away from my children. Therefore, I am determined to make those dollars count. I pick pennies up off the street. I sell stuff I don’t want. I make the most of all that we have, and I always try to remember what that money really means.

So what now?

I am only in my thirties, and I hope to have many decades ahead of me. But nobody knows for sure. If I’m lucky, I’ll get to make years of priceless memories with my family and friends. I hope to turn dollars into fortunes by saving and investing all that I can. I want to use my frugal lifestyle to buy time… and I want to enjoy every second of it.

I will never forget the conversation I had with my friend. I will always remember the lesson she taught me. Her words were a precious gift. I know that now, and I am more serious than ever about getting the most out of life that I can.

My friend was right. One day I just may sit where she sits. One day, many years from now, I might be longing for the years I am living right now. When that day comes, I’m sure I will want to trade everything I have for one more day, one more moment, or one more hug. I don’t want to have any regrets. I hope to look back and know that I made the most out of every second I had.

Our time is invaluable

Life is a precious gift, and it’s moving faster now than ever before. I’m still young, but I’m determined to make the most out of my money and my time. And I am going to enjoy the moments with my family, knowing that one day the memories will be all that’s left. Money comes and goes, but time is priceless. I will always treasure the lesson I learned from my friend. “Be careful with your time, young lady. It’s precious.”

Just once, I'd like to go on vacation for a week or ten days and not go anywhere. No plane trip, no shitty rental car, no "what are we doing today?", nothing. Just sitting on my front porch watching the grass grow. I realize we came up with a word for that during the Great Recession of '08-'09, but I never got one of those.

We always plan these things months in advance, and spend more time on the planning part than actually going on the vacation itself. Then we get there, and it's more work and stress and bullshit than actually going to work. We get back, and I swear I'm not going to do it again, but as soon as the wheels hit the tarmac, my wife is at it again, planning, planning, planning for next year. "Dave, can you come here and look at this website?" "How about this one?" "Ooh, isn't this nice?" And then there's the one that really sets me off, "how about you get online and help me find a place to go on vacation?" I'd rather pull my own fingernails out with a pair of pliers.
