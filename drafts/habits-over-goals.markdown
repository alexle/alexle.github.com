Goal Don't Make You Successful

That’s because today we’re talking about keystone habits. These are the habits that — once implemented — have a positive impact on many other facets of your life.

 That’s because today we’re talking about keystone habits. These are the habits that — once implemented — have a positive impact on many other facets of your life.

3 keystone habits that’ll change your life
Not all keystone habits are necessarily positive. After all, if you pick up the habit of smoking a pack a day or drinking a sixer of Bud Light each night, you’re going to see it impact other areas of your life negatively.

However, if you recognize good keystone habits and adopt them, you’ll find that your life can drastically improve because of one simple change.

Here are three of the best ones you can implement to help get you started.

Keystone habit 1: More exercise

Exercising regularly is perhaps the most impactful keystone habit you can implement.

And it makes sense. Once you start exercising, you’re not only becoming more conscious about the way your body looks but also what you’re putting into your body as well.

This consciousness starts to spread to other areas of your life. Maybe you’re not eating takeout or going to bars as often, because it’s unhealthy. That means you’re saving money each month you’d otherwise have spent going out.

Keystone habit 2: Better sleep

One of the most harmful side effects of “hustle culture” is countless people out there forgoing sleep. After all, more time awake means more work done … right?

Wrong. In fact, studies have shown that a lack of sleep increases the chances of stroke, heart disease, and an early death (which — you know — definitely cuts down the time you can get work done).

I Will Teach You To Be Rich’s founder and CEO Ramit Sethi even wrote about this in his post on productivity:

“My fundamental 80% Win here is that I sleep 7.5 to 8 hours almost every night. It’s not sexy. But as I’m writing this at 9:34am, I slept 8 hours last night and I woke up knowing I was going to have a productive day.”

When you get adequate sleep, your mind and body are primed for a productive day. That means more energy and mental capacity to do the work you want to do — and do it well.

“When I wake up after a full, uninterrupted night’s sleep, I’m ready to meet the day,” says Richard, a Denver-based programmer and IT technician. “I have more energy in the day to get work done and I don’t feel that afternoon drag where I feel like I need a nap.”

If you wake up groggy on four hours of sleep, do you think you’ll be as productive? Sure, you might have more time to work on things, but if your mind and body aren’t in the right place, you sure as heck aren’t getting as many things done.





It’s an old familiar hum:

Every January, we kickoff the calendar year with New Years Resolutions: lose 10 pounds, make smarter investments, create an extra $1,500 per month on the side.

Yet by February, we’ve returned to life as usual. The discarded New Years Resolution has become a tired cultural trope.

We blame ourselves for these failures:

“I should work harder.”
“I should be more disciplined.”
“I should stop procrastinating.”
But what if we’re approaching this in the wrong way? What if goal-setting itself is the problem? 




Start small to get big results

Eventually, I got sick of feeling this way. I got tired of dreaming. I wanted to be doing. So I started small — not with a goal or a resolution, not even a dream, but with simple habits.

I started running every morning because after a few years of newlywed home cooking, I was getting fat.
I started writing every morning because I figured that’s what real writers did, and I wanted to be a real writer.
I started carving out little blocks of time to work on the things that mattered most to me.
And gradually, these little habits grew into a part of my daily practice. They became the thing that made me feel like me.

I distinctly remember one morning getting up before dawn, running five miles, eating breakfast, taking a shower, and sitting down with my cup of coffee and writing 1000 words — all before 7:00 a.m.

Who was this person I had become?

It felt good.

In fact, it felt so good I never stopped doing it.

And those little habits changed my life.


I’m a reformed goal junkie.

Once obsessed with setting every 1-5-10 year goal under the sun, I now cannot be bothered with them. Because they’re so tied to achievement, and so rarely tied to the things that really matter to us. They sound good on paper, but they have little follow through. We can’t just write a goal down and expect it to make us happy. Just like we can’t write a goal down and expect it to happen.

Have you ever set out to accomplish a goal, only to feel a whole lot of “OK, now what?” once you’ve achieved it. Or worked REALLY hard towards something and the bottom just completely falls out on your desire once you get there like, “OK, this is it?” Setting a goal won’t make us happy. And they sure as heck won’t change your life. You won’t be any happier when …than you are right now. Right now.




For a better 2019, create systems, not goals

People have been pledging new year self-improvement goals for thousands of years (ancient Babylonians first made start of year promises back in 1894 BC).

Everyone has a number of goals, but it’s the commitment to a system, a course of action, that makes the difference.

A system is something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of success regardless of the immediate outcome.

Guardian’s Oliver Burkman, explains, “Drawing one cartoon a day is a system; so is resolving to take some kind of exercise daily — rather than setting a goal, like being able to run a marathon in four hours.”

Systems allow us to take control of our lives.

A working system allows you to reduce your tasks to a manageable set of inputs and outputs, and establish some predictability.

A collection of goals, tools, habits, and methods is not the same as a purposeful system.

Systems are the foundation of deep, focused and efficient work.

Systems give you the freedom to do your best work every day without making the same mistakes over and over again.

Systems are consistent.

In “How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big”, author Scott Adams explains: “A goal is a specific objective that you either achieve or don’t sometime in the future. A system is something you do on a regular basis that achieves your odds of happiness in the long run. If you do something every day, it’s a system. If you’re waiting to achieve it someday in the future, it’s a goal.”

Cultivating the right system can make all the difference in your productive life. Using systems can make your life easier.

A system provides you with an inner guidance system and a equip you with the power of habit.

In 2019, define what is meaningful to you, better still, choose what you would like to change, and create systems to get them done.

James Clear says, “When you focus on the practice instead of the performance, you can enjoy the present moment and improve at the same time.” He writes:

“If you’re a coach, your goal is to win a championship. Your system is what your team does at practice each day. 
If you’re a writer, your goal is to write a book. Your system is the writing schedule that you follow each week. 
If you’re a runner, your goal is to run a marathon. Your system is your training schedule for the month. 
If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal is to build a million dollar business. Your system is your sales and marketing process.”

You are never going to be truly successful until you have a working system that guides your actions and helps you achieve your goals.

A system makes your goal real. It’s concrete. It gets you moving. It helps you focus on long-terms gains, instead of short-term wins. 
Writing a book in 6 months is a great goal but you need structure/system that will make it easier to achieve that goal.

Many writers commit to a few hundred words a day. They commit to a schedule that works for them. A system that makes it easier to take a step closer to the goal.

When you commit to a system, you are far more likely to stick to it. Systems are about the long-term process rather than the short-term result.

A structure in your life and some routines that help you every day and keep you on the right track is better than a single shot at getting something done.

If you intend to get into better shape, build a successful business, or write a best-selling book, systems will get you closer to that goal than a radical one-time shot at achieving your most important goal.

Joe Frazier once said, “Champions aren’t made in the ring, they are merely recognized there.”

Anyone who has set and achieved a goal understands the importance of a system. The processes, routines, and habits, that support the achievement of a goal.

Systems as habits

Start anything with a clear goal and focus on the system to achieve it.

Effective goal getting systems begin with clarity concerning your goals. Effort without purpose is wasted effort.

Many people have different successful systems that guide how they work and what actions to take at any point in time to achieve the bigger purpose.

If your current system of work doesn’t work or give the desired results you expect, make a change, create a new system and take steps every day to stick to it.

By spending a little bit of time figuring out what will work best for you and your habits, you can put yourself in a great position to get out of your head and get things done. 
Reserving an hour each day for something you absolutely want to get done can be a great system that can help you achieve your big goal.

Burkman says, “…focusing on a system means focusing on what you can control (your actions) rather than what you can’t (the endlessly unpredictable external world). Keep working your system and you’ll maximize the chances that success will find you.”

You can start building systems one habit at a time.

Focus on incremental progress and consistency to lay the foundation for getting things done.






We’ve just started the third month of the year, and with the realization that this year is slipping past us so quickly … I’m issuing a challenge to all of you.

My March Challenge is to pick one small change that will have a big impact on your life. One small change you can do every day. Then do it every single day, at the same time every day.

Small changes can add up to having a huge impact on our lives in a few ways:

They can lead to long-term change, even .
They can be expanded slowly to bigger changes.
Even if they aren’t expanded, they can make us feel healthier, more energetic, more mindful or calm, and so on … and that can spread to an impact in all other areas of our lives.
Better finances or health (for example) can lead to less stress, which can lead to us being more present, grounded and sane in our relationships, jobs and responsibilities.
So pick one small change that will have one or more of these effects on your life (or other great effects you might think of). Then commit to doing it every day for this month.

Pushups — if you do just 10 pushups every day (or whatever level you think would be easy and doable), you’ll get stronger over the course of a month. And that might lead to a slow expansion of the exercise habit, so that in April perhaps you add lunges, then bodyweight squats, then chinups … soon you’re fit and feeling good all the livelong day.
Veggies — add green veggies to one meal a day, and it will have a good effect on your health over the long term. Especially if you expand that to two meals a day, and slowly add veggies so that you’re eating 4-5 servings a day. Wow!
Writing habit — even just 10 minutes a day of writing can lead to a book, a blog, or maybe a lifetime journaling habit.
Declutter or clean — spend 10 minutes decluttering one shelf, one space on your counter or in your closet, and over the course of a month you’ll have made a huge dent in your clutter. If you’re fairly clutter-free, you can spend a little time cleaning different areas of your house. A clean environment can get you in a great mindset for being focused, calm and present for everything you do.
Finances — spending a little time paying bills, cutting costs, working on a budget, or tracking your expenses, even if it’s just 10 minutes a day, can have a big long-term effect on your finances. Or maybe you work on increasing your income, getting a side freelancing gig or selling something online, to improve your finances — just a little work each day can make a huge difference.
Go for a walk — a daily walk can make you feel better, give you space to think, to breathe, to get away from distractions (don’t look at your phone or listen to anything when you walk). You get healthier, enjoy the outdoors. It’s like a meditation with exercise benefits.
Reach out to people — calling or writing to a few people every day can improve your relationships. Or it might help you with job prospects, increasing your network.
Replace negative thinking patterns with gratitude — this can be more difficult because you have to be more aware throughout the day. But when you notice yourself with a resentful or complaining thought pattern, interrupt the process and think about what you’re grateful for. Or allow yourself to feel the pain of what you’re feeling, without going down the resentful path, choosing gratitude instead. This has a huge effect on your happiness and relationships, not to mention long-term health.
Do a small kindness for others — pick a few small acts of kindness and do one a day for a stranger, or pick something small to make a loved one feel loved. It will have a big impact on others and get you out of the narrow self-centered perspective that most of us get stuck in.
Sleep & wake a little earlier — I find that shifting my sleep a bit earlier can give me time to meditate, exercise, read or write. All great things!




So with that in mind, I’m going to post those 7 habits again below in hopes they spark something inside of you too! The 7 habits that have a high rate of return in life, via James Clear (I swear I’m not obsessed with him… or am I?): 

Sleep 8+ hours each day
Lift weights 3x week (I substituted this for “exercising” 3x a week)
Go for a walk each day
Save at least 10 percent of your income
Read every day
Drink more water and less of everything else
Leave your phone in another room while you work

Financial 7
 track your money
 401k match
 pay off credit cards
 automate saving
  emergency fund
  Be content with what you have
 
  



There are countless articles on the Internet talking about how to accomplish great things — the wall we want to build — in work and life — and these can be confusing sometimes. In fact, the essential path to getting there is perfectly captured in a sentence by Will Smith.

You don’t set out to build a wall. You don’t say ‘I’m going to build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that’s ever been built.’ You don’t start there. You say, ‘I’m going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid. You do that every single day. And soon you have a wall.

The secret is NOT to focus on the vision. You may argue that vision is important in leading us in the right direction. And you’re right. However, we don’t usually start with a perfect vision.

Instead, start taking action, collecting feedback, and course-correcting your path. Start by laying one brick at a time. And soon, as Smith said, you will eventually have the wall.

The Underrated Power of Tiny Action

In most circumstances, when people talk about the action they’ve taken, they’re talking about a big accomplishment they’ve achieved or a huge leap they’ve made in their work or life. We start losing sight of all the small things we do every day when we surround ourselves with these conversations.

We think small actions are not important. At the same time, we believe that we’re not doing enough. We started to believe that to achieve great things, we should do something extraordinary, something worth cheering about and something that captures other’s attention.

At the end of the day, we get nothing because all we ever think about is the wall we want to build, instead of actually building the wall. And that’s why I hope this story of Will Smith reminds you of something important: Every tiny action matters.






A little bit of effort, over and over again, is all it takes to build serious wealth.

"You don't set out to build a wall. You don't say 'I'm going to build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that's ever been built.' You don't start there. You say, 'I'm going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid.' You do that every single day. And soon you have a wall." - Will Smith



2. Lay one brick a day
Pick a big career or financial goal, like building a 6-figure business, quitting your job, or launching a new career.

Then for the next 24 months, commit to laying only one brick a day.

Take only ONE action each day that moves you closer to your goal.

If it’s too hard to do just one thing per day then you don’t want it bad enough.

It doesn’t have to be big, but it does have to be something.

Over time, this will compound and lead to huge results.




Lesson 3: Don’t Set Goals
For years I set goals and never achieved them. It was horrible.

I’d write them on scraps of paper, put them in a drawer, and forget about them.

What’s the saying? A goal without a plan is just a dream?

Well, I like to dream… a little too much.

But I like accomplishing things even more.

Note: If you’d like to attend a free webinar on how to set goals and actually achieve them, click here.
For the greater part of a decade, I would set goals — I mean, dreams — and never achieve them. I was drifting through my life, fantasizing about living another way but doing nothing to make that fantasy a reality.

Honestly, I didn’t know how.

Eventually, I got so burnt-out that I just gave up the entire process. Resolutions, goals, dreams — those were for suckers. I was content to just live my life without any big ambitions.

Except that I wasn’t.

Secretly, I was disappointed with my life and with myself for building such a life. I felt trapped and didn’t know how to make things better.


Start small to get big results
Eventually, I got sick of feeling this way. I got tired of dreaming. I wanted to be doing. So I started small — not with a goal or a resolution, not even a dream, but with simple habits.

I started running every morning because after a few years of newlywed home cooking, I was getting fat.
I started writing every morning because I figured that’s what real writers did, and I wanted to be a real writer.
I started carving out little blocks of time to work on the things that mattered most to me.
And gradually, these little habits grew into a part of my daily practice. They became the thing that made me feel like me.

I distinctly remember one morning getting up before dawn, running five miles, eating breakfast, taking a shower, and sitting down with my cup of coffee and writing 1000 words — all before 7:00 a.m.

Who was this person I had become?

It felt good.

In fact, it felt so good I never stopped doing it.

And those little habits changed my life.

The power of daily habits

This didn’t happen, because I set some goals and forgot about them. It happened because I learned the importance of habits. I got serious about what I wanted to see happen and worked that into my daily life.

This was something I learned from my friend Michael Hyatt who is probably the most disciplined and organized person I know. He crushes goals. And I was amazed to hear that he reviews his goals on a daily basis.

I guess that makes sense. Once I learned the power of daily habits, I started setting goals again.

Year-in and year-out consistency can make all the difference in the world when it comes to making a big jump in performance. “Distance running takes patience,” says Art Siemers, head cross-country coach at Colorado State University. “My main focus is finding athletes with the desire, commitment, and patience to slowly build an aerobic base over their early college years, aiming toward a big breakthrough once the body adapts to the stress of higher mileage. This can be a challenge in the age of instant gratification, but those athletes who possess patience and a strong work ethic usually succeed.”

This same type of patience applies to noncollegians as well. It can be hard to keep training when it seems like you’ve plateaued, but staying consistent creates the changes that lead to new levels of performance down the road.


Are you willing to spend a little time every day (like most people won’t), so you can spend the better part of your life like most people can’t?

Think about that question for a moment.  Let it sink in.  You ultimately become (an expert) at what you repeatedly do in life.

And isn’t it funny how day by day nothing changes, but when you look back everything is different?  That’s the power of daily rituals.

Now, it’s time think about your rituals — the little things you do every day that occupy your attention and energy.

Because in many ways these little things define YOU.

Most people don't meet their goals for the same 4 reasons. Your goals are typically set as outcomes, such as "lose 50 pounds," "make $100,000 in paid speeches," "save $25,000," and the like. And it makes sense because, after all, you care more about losing 50 pounds than about working out every day.

You care more about making $100,000 in paid speeches than about the required marketing activities. You care more about saving $25,000 than about spending less. You care about the goals and the benefits from them, more than about the actions you must perform to reach them.






However, Buffett is the perfect example of sequential success. You can achieve big things with small actions, that build up over time.

This is not only true for money. The same concept applies to skills, health, and relationships.

You don’t build a strong body in a day, month, or even a year. It takes years of consistent effort. Shortcuts don’t exist, no matter how ‘smart’ you work.

For example, cyclists under the age of 28 rarely win big races like The Tour The France because it takes them years to build the strength, stamina, and mindset you need to win.

If you want to see the impact of compounding in your own life, it requires you to focus on one thing at a time (for every aspect of your life) and always look at the bigger picture.

It comes down to this: You’ll get there if you put in the work. Who cares if it’s tomorrow or 20 years? It will happen. That’s all that matters.



It’s been two months since the start of the new year.

How are things going for you?

There’s a good chance that your answer is: “Not great.”

There’s a good chance that the optimism and motivation and momentum you started the year with have faded.

Setbacks have arisen. Unfinished to-dos have piled up. You’ve gotten out of the groove with your fledgling habits. Your mood has soured. Your morale has sagged. Your focus feels fragmented. Goals that just a month ago seemed within reach, now seem unattainable.

You’ve gotten royally off track.

You feel like you need a do-over. And you’re right.

You need a reset day. What Is a Reset Day?
Despite one’s best intentions in turning over a new leaf, life happens. Forging new habits isn’t easy, while slowly moving away from them is. The best way to deal with that drift is to get re-aligned before you’ve gotten too far off track — to constantly make little course corrections as you continue towards your goal.

But sometimes, one bad week leads to another, and things flat out unravel. You just get totally off track with the path you want to be on. In such a case, tinkering around the edges doesn’t work. The momentum of your off-kilter current is too strong, your schedule just too busy, to fully get back in a good headspace. You need an uninterrupted stretch, a solid block of time in which you can clear the decks – all of them.

Enter the reset day.



Setting goals is critical. Goals provide direction, help you focus, prioritize your time and energy, and ensure that you can objectively prove you’ve advanced the company’s agenda.


As the famous management consultant Peter Drucker said, “If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.”




Chances are good that you’ve already decided to ditch your New Year’s resolution.

By the second week of the year, 31% of people have already abandoned their goals, and by the end of the month that number will grow to just under 50%, Fast Company reports.

Keeping up with your lofty dreams of reading for an hour each night or running five days a week can be difficult, so difficult in fact that you fail, and fail hard, early in your attempt. And when that failure happens, we often decide to just give the goal up entirely rather than give it another go.

If you’re already suffering from a failed New Year’s resolution instead of ditching the dream, try reframing it.

Fast Company notes that more often than not our resolutions are for specific activities like that “running five times a week” thing rather than the larger picture. Instead of focusing on the activity component, instead, focus on what your larger goal is.

The System
Big goals never work. At least, not on their own.

In my weekly newsletter, I wrote:

It’s not that most people fail their New Year’s Resolutions. It’s that most people fail their resolutions, period. Resolutions, like goals, only tell us where we want to go, not how to get there. For that, you need a system.”
So what system do I plan to use?

The most important thing for these kinds of goals is psychology. As long as I keep writing, finishing and submitting stories, I’ll get to my goal.

So, my current plan is made up of daily habits and weekly goals:

Write 1000 words a day.
Actively read professional short stories.
Critique amateur short stories.
Join several writing communities and attend regular meetings.




3. Our everyday habits form our future selves.
What you do today is one more action toward who you will be tomorrow.

When that action is replicated over the course of a week, you begin to scratch the surface of change.
When that action is replicated over the course of a month, you begin to notice a slight difference.
When that action replicated over the course of a year, or two years, or five years, you may no longer recognize yourself — you will have changed, in that particular way, completely.
Do not underestimate the power of each and every small habit, replicated over time.
For good or bad, your habits determine who you will ultimately become.

4. Your emotions




Remember back in January, 2017, when you made that big long list of goals?

How many did you actually accomplish? How many did you give up on?

People have no problem setting goals.

The challenge is in seeing them through to the end.

With just two months left in the year, I encourage you think about your goals a bit differently. Come November, most people start to feel a great deal of angst about how the year went. They either feel a huge sense of accomplishment and choose to take it easy for the remainder of the year—or they feel a sense of failure and scramble to get something done in order to feel accomplished.

I suggest not doing either.






Staying motivated enough to work toward our goals can be tough. The minutia of life can get in the way of our lofty dreams—which is where the non-zero method comes in. The idea is simple: do just one thing every day that help you move toward what you want to achieve. Even if that’s just performing one sit up or drinking a glass of water, at least you’ll have made some progress.

Here are some low-effort ways you can have a non-zero day:

Eating healthier: Choose one meal in your day to be primarily made up of vegetables.
Working out: Do five push ups or crunches or jumping jacks or stretches.
Mental health: Spend one minute practicing mindfulness meditation or breathing exercises.
Relationships: Send one text, email, or make a quick phone call to someone you care about.



Pledge to run, walk or bike at least one consecutive mile every day. You’ll find that once you get started, there will be days when you want to go farther—and then there will be days when one mile is enough (or more than enough). Either way, you’ll get pulled in—you won’t want to break your pledge, even if that means getting up super-early before a long car ride to squeeze in your mile.




4. Stay In Love With The Process
“The more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war.” — Norman Schwarzkopf

The process — or the work itself — is all there is. Results come and go. And it’s never been about the results. Success is inevitable.

Success comes easy because it’s the last thing on your mind. You already know it’s going to happen.

The work itself — and becoming better and better at it — is what drives you. It almost doesn’t matter what you’re doing. It’s why you’re doing it that matters.


To achieve this consistency, you need to develop daily habits. Habits are key to behaviour change because once you form them, you don’t need to rely on willpower or motivation. As Maneesh Sethi puts it:

“Think about how it feels to go to bed without brushing your teeth. It feels wrong. You feel like your day isn’t complete - and you’ll even drag yourself out of bed to do it. Why? Because brushing is so deeply ingrained into your daily routine that it actually requires more willpower to NOT brush than just to brush! It’s a deeply formed habit - and you rarely miss a day.”







Life Goals Are a Waste of Time, Here’s What You Should Do Instead
People set all kinds of goals. To visit Paris and see the Eiffel Tower, to run a marathon in less than four hours, to swim with dolphins, to earn a million dollars, to be your own boss, to own a mansion, to find true love — the list, mostly mundane and predictable, is endless.

We live in an age where goals are king. Our societies tell us that setting and achieving them is not just the only way to lead a fulfilling life, and thus the only way to be truly happy, but that we also need to enjoy the process in between — the “journey,” they call it.

It’s a pervasive phenomenon and it affects how we feel about the success of ourselves and others (or lack thereof), and about how we approach life itself. “Work Hard, Dream Big,” as Nike says. “Just Do It.”




Goals don’t make positive changes happen, daily rituals do.

Seriously, meditate on that for a moment.

Because too often we obsess ourselves with a goal – an end result – but are completely unfocused when it comes to the ritual – the recurring steps – that ultimately make the goal happen.  And so the weight of this unrealized goal sits heavy on our shoulders, and it slows us down to a crawl.

Does that sound at all familiar?

If so, it’s time to shift your focus AWAY from your goals.  Think about this…

If you completely ignored one of your goals for the next few weeks and instead focused solely on the daily rituals that reinforce this goal, would you still get positive results?

For example, if you were trying to lose weight and you ignored your goal to lose 25 pounds, and instead focused only on eating healthy and exercising each day, would you still get results? The bottom line is that nothing will change in your life unless you make daily rituals that reinforce what you hope to achieve




Like many people, Angel and I spent years struggling to make even the slightest bit of progress on the goals we had set for ourselves.

We started new workout programs with incredible optimism at least a couple dozen times.  We threw away all the junk food in our house more times than I can even remember.  We tried waking up earlier, meditating, reading more often, writing a book, getting out of debt, running a business, and more…

But, for the longest time, we failed on all fronts.

We’d get started with a new goal, and then we’d get derailed.

And boy did we feel horrible!

We often felt like losers … like no matter how hard we tried, our goals were out of reach!  And we’d berate ourselves constantly for not being stronger, smarter, and more disciplined.

But what Angel and I didn’t realize, until we started successfully achieving our goals a few years later, is that it was never a matter of us not having enough strength, intelligence, or discipline.  It was a matter of us focusing on our goals in an ineffective way.

In fact, believe it or not, we were actually focusing on our goals too much.

Yes, you read that right.  It sounds counterintuitive, but it’s the truth.








The problem with goal pursuit is that you become shackled to your own motivations. You spend far more time chasing the goal than you do enjoying the success that comes with achieving it.

Human behavior expert Oliver Burkeman explained it best to The Guardian, quoting cartoonist Scott Adams’s book, How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big:



“When you approach life as a sequence of milestones to be achieved, you exist “in a state of near-continuous failure”. Almost all the time, by definition, you’re not at the place you’ve defined as embodying accomplishment or success. And should you get there, you’ll find you’ve lost the very thing that gave you a sense of purpose – so you’ll formulate a new goal and start again.”



Nothing will change your future trajectory like habits.

We all have goals, big or small things which we want to achieve within a certain time frame. Some people want to make a million dollars by the time they turn 30. Some want to lose 20lb before summer. Some want to write a book in the next 6 months. When we begin to chase an intangible or vague concept (success, wealth, health, happiness) making a tangible goal is often the first step.

Habits are processes operating in the background that powers our lives. Good habits help us reach our goals. Bad ones hinder us. Either way habits powerfully influence our automatic behavior.

The difference between habits and goals is not semantic. Each requires different forms of action. For example:

We want to learn a new language. We could decide we want to be fluent in 6 months (goal), or we could commit to 30-minutes of practice each day (habit.)
We want to read more books. We could set the goal to read 50 books by the end of the year, or we could decide to always carry one (habit.)
We want to spend more time with family. We could plan to spend 7 hours a week with family (goal), or we could choose to eat dinner with them each night (habit.)
The Problems With Goals

When we want to change an aspect of our lives, setting a goal is often the logical first step. Despite being touted by many a self-help guru, this approach has some problematic facets.

Goals have an endpoint. This is why many people revert to their previous state after achieving a certain goal. People run marathons, then stop exercising altogether afterward. Or they make a certain amount of money, then fall into debt soon after. Others reach a goal weight, only to spoil their progress by overeating to celebrate.

Goals rely on factors which we do not always have control over. It’s an unavoidable fact that reaching a goal is not always possible, regardless of effort. An injury might derail a fitness goal. An unexpected expense might sabotage a financial goal. A family tragedy might impede a creative output goal. When we set a goal, we are attempting to transform what is usually a heuristic process into an algorithmic one.

Goals rely on willpower and self-discipline. As Charles Duhigg wrote in The Power of Habit:


Willpower isn’t just a skill. It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over for other things.


Keeping a goal in mind and using it to direct our actions requires constant willpower. During times when other parts of our lives deplete our supply, it can be easy to forget it. For example, the goal of saving money requires self-discipline each time we make a purchase. Meanwhile, the habit of putting $50 in a savings account weekly requires little effort. Habits, not goals, make otherwise difficult things easy.

Goals can make us complacent or reckless. Studies have shown that people’s brains can confuse goal setting with achievement. This effect is pronounced when they inform others. Furthermore, unrealistic goals can lead to dangerous or unethical behavior.

The Benefits of Habits

“Habit is the intersection of knowledge (what to do), skill (how to do), and desire (want to do).”
— Stephen Covey


Once formed habits operate automatically. Habits take otherwise difficult tasks—like saving money—and make them easy.

The purpose of a well-crafted set of habits is to ensure we reach our goals with incremental steps. The benefits of a systematic approach to achievement include:

Habits can mean we overshot our goals. Let’s say a person’s goal is to write a novel. They decide to write 200 words a day, meaning it should take 250 days. Writing 200 words takes little effort, and even on the busiest, most stressful days they get it done. However, on some days that small step leads to them writing 1000 or more. As a result, they finish the book in much less time.Yet setting ‘write a book in 4 months’ as a goal would have been intimidating.

Habits are easy to complete. As Duhigg wrote;


Habits are powerful, but delicate. They can emerge outside our consciousness or can be deliberately designed. They often occur without our permission but can be reshaped by fiddling with their parts. They shape our lives far more than we realize—they are so strong, in fact, that they cause our brains to cling to them at the exclusion of all else, including common sense.”


Once we develop a habit, our brains actually change to make the behavior easier to complete. After about 30 days of practice, enacting a habit becomes easier than not doing so.

Habits are for life. Our lives are structured around habits, many of them barely noticeable. According to Duhigg’s research, habits make up 40% of our waking hours. These, often minuscule actions which add up to make who we are. William James (a man who knew the problems caused by bad habits) summarized their importance as such:


All our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits – practical, emotional, and intellectual – systematically organized for our weal or woe, and bearing us irresistibly toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be.


Once a habit becomes ingrained, it can last for life (unless broken for some reason.)

Habits can compound. Stephen Covey paraphrased Gandhi when he explained:


Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny.


In other words, building a single habit can have a wider impact on our lives. Duhigg calls these ‘keystone habits.'

These behaviors which cause people to change related areas of their lives. For example, people who start exercising daily may end up eating better and drinking less. Likewise, those who quit a bad habit may end up replacing it with a positive alternative. (Naval and I talked about habit replacement a lot on this podcast episode).

Habits can be as small as necessary. A common piece of advice for those seeking to build a habit is to start small. Stanford psychologist BJ Fogg recommends ‘tiny habits’, such as flossing one tooth. Once these become ingrained, the degree of complexity can increase. If you want to read more you can start with 25 pages a day. AFter this becomes part of your routine, you can increase the page number to reach your goal.







However Adams (the cartoonist who wrote the How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big book mentioned earlier) has an altogether different alternative: systems. Systems stand in contrast to goals in that a system is “something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run.” A writer setting out to write 500 words a day is using a system, so is a person taking up some kind of daily exercise – rather than setting a goal, like being able to run a marathon in four hours or run a mile in five minutes.

Another popular system online is called “No Zero Days”: the idea behind it being to doing something, no matter how tiny or how little effort needed, towards a larger project every single day.






Goals don’t make positive changes happen, daily rituals do.

Seriously, meditate on that for a moment.

Because too often we obsess ourselves with a big goal – a big end result – but are completely unfocused when it comes to the ritual – the recurring steps – that ultimately make the goal happen.  And so the weight of this big, unrealized goal sits heavy on our mind and brings our progress down to a crawl.

Does that sound at all familiar?

If so, it’s time to shift your focus AWAY from your goals.  Think about this…

If you completely ignored one of your goals for the next few weeks and instead focused solely on the daily rituals that reinforce this goal, would you still get positive results?

For example, if you were trying to lose weight and you ignored your goal to lose 25 pounds, and instead focused only on eating healthy and exercising each day, would you still get results?


Regardless of your unique life circumstances, or how you define success, you don’t suddenly become successful.  You become successful over time from all the little things you do every day.

Failure occurs in the same way.  All your little daily failures (that you don’t learn and grow from) come together and cause you to fail…

You fail to check the books.
You fail to make the call.
You fail to listen to your customers.
You fail to innovate.
You fail to make necessary shifts…
And then one day you wake up and your business has failed, and you’re stressed out beyond belief.  It was all the little things you did or didn’t do along the way, not just one inexplicable, catastrophic event.




Often we think it's the giant leaps that lead to this kind of reinvention, but usually it's a series of small steps," Goins writes. Grisham became a writer by "stealing away a little time, thirty minutes to an hour each day. That was it. With a growing family and a new career, it would have been reckless to quit law and become a full-­time author. In fact, that wasn't even his goal; he was just writing to see if he could do it. He took one step at a time, and three years later he had a book."

"More often than not, our creative dreams aren't launched overnight. They are built gradually. When you are in a season of life when you can't dedicate hours a day to your craft, it can feel like you're standing still. But at those times, when the odds are overwhelming and the busyness is suffocating, you still have something to give. The effort may seem small and insignificant, but the work adds up."

In his New York Times list of writing tips, Grisham has one more nugget of advice about being consistent: "Write your one page each day at the same place and time. Early morning, lunch break, on the train, late at night -- it doesn't matter. Find the extra hour, go to the same place, shut the door. No exceptions, no excuses."



4. Focus On The Process
Zen Monks and Masters don’t care about results. They focus on habits, rituals, and processes that support the Zen way of living.

Too often, we stare blindly on the results we want to achieve that we forget why we do something in the first place.

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with trying to achieve things. You don’t have to give up everything and move to a monastery.

But make sure you develop habits and rituals that support what you’re trying to achieve in life. When you focus on the process, the outcome will follow automatically.



Discipline

Discipline is the foundation of achieving goals. You check off a to-do list and achieve your goals by having the discipline to do the necessary work every day, whether it is completing a work project, a side hustle, building your network or striving to exercise more, having the discipline to do things when you don’t want to do them, repeatedly is the foundation of excellence. As Aristotle wrote, “excellence is not an act, but a habit,” and having the discipline to create good habits is what will fundamentally improve your life.

Time Management

Goals are met one day at a time. The key to ensuring you complete the necessary tasks for the day, and work ahead on looming deadlines is to learn how to work efficiently and manage your time. Prioritizing well and strategically allotting the time you need will help keep you on pace, and will enable you to complete everything you need and want to every day. The sooner you learn to manage your time, the sooner you will start getting more done. The more you get done, the more goals you will accomplish.





1. They set various types of goals.

Goals vary and will likely change as you improve and gain more running experience. Newer runners may want simply to complete the distance for the first time, while more experienced runners may be focused on running a personal best or hitting a desired time. Regardless of your intentions, there are two types of goals: outcome goals and process goals. Highly effective runners recognize the importance of both.

Outcome goals are what most people think of when they talk about goal setting. These are the intended result of all your hard work and preparation and are specific (e.g., lose weight, finish the race) and measurable (e.g., finish in 2 hours, place top 5 in age group). Thinking about outcome goals induces both excitement and nerves. But they’re also largely out of your control. And let’s be honest, if you knew exactly how fast you were going to run on race day, a lot of the fun would be taken out of the whole experience. That’s what makes outcome goals so exciting. And nerve-racking.

Equally as—or even more important—than outcome goals are process goals. They’re not as exciting and probably won’t make you nervous when you think about them. But the great news is that process goals, unlike outcome goals, are completely in your control. And the more of them you achieve with regularity, the more confidence you’ll gain.

These two kinds of goals are linked. The more successful you are at accomplishing your process goals—habitual actions you can check off every day, such as getting 8 hours of sleep a night, making healthy food choices at mealtime, doing core-strengthening exercises daily, etc.—the better you’ll set yourself up for achieving your outcome goals.



The difference between who you are now and who you were five years ago is largely due to how you've spent your time along the way.

The habits we groove become who we are, one minute at a time. A small thing, repeated, is not a small thing.



2. They enjoy the process.

Many runners make the mistake of only setting outcome goals, and their idea of success or enjoyment hinges upon hitting a desired time in workouts or races or securing a particular placing on race day. This can induce unnecessary pressure and lead to frustration and feelings of failure if these goals aren’t achieved, thus killing the fun factor of one of our favorite activities.

Highly effective runners enjoy the ongoing process of training and competing.

Even though races tend to be the culmination of weeks or months of training, the reality is the process never really ends. Learn to appreciate the enjoyment of an easy run as much as the feeling of pushing beyond your limits in a workout or race. Cherish the time you get to spend with your training partners and motivate one another to improve. Don’t sink too low after a poor race or let a bombed workout ruin your day. Remind yourself that training is an ongoing purpose and the more enjoyment you can find in it—even on your toughest days—the more effective tomorrow will be.



3. They value consistency.

“The best way to get better at anything is by doing it consistently,” coach Joe Rubio told Competitor.com in 2014.

Simple advice, right? Well it is, but that doesn’t mean consistency is an easy thing to achieve. You need to work at it every day. Consistency doesn’t just mean running on a regular basis (although there’s a lot of value in that) but it’s more about developing good habits that become part of your running lifestyle. Whether you’re super fit or completely out of shape, consistency will go a long way in helping you to eliminate excuses on your way to improving your fitness, enhancing enjoyment and becoming a more effective runner.

Find a training program that works for you and stick with it instead of chasing the latest hot trend. Establish a weekly routine that works for your schedule and don’t waver from it. Make time for the preventative exercises you need to do to help ward off injury. Get to bed at a decent hour every night. Remember: Success is the result of doing the right things day after day and week after week.


Setting a goal, no mater how simple is always the easy part. Everyone has goals. The real challenge is not determining if you want the result, but if you are willing to accept the sacrifices required to achieve your goals.

If you want to achieve your goals at all times, create a system that works. Instead of a goal, design a great system or process. That way, you will always win. Even when your short-term goals are achieved, your next goal won’t be a struggle. Having a system is what matters. Committing to the process makes a huge difference.

The idea here is to focus on consistent improvements in your life, every day, not matter how small the step you take to be a better you than you were yesterday.

According to Brett and Kate McKay of The Art of Manliness:

“Instead of trying to make radical changes in a short amount of time, just make small improvements every day that will gradually lead to the change you want. Each day, just focus on getting 1% better in whatever it is you’re trying to improve. That’s it. Just 1%.

It might not seem like much, but those 1% improvements start compounding on each other. In the beginning, your improvements will be so small as to seem practically nonexistent. But gradually and ever so slowly, you’ll start to notice the improvements in your life. It may take months or even years, but the improvements will come if you just focus on consistently upping your game by 1%.”

Here is why Kaizen works
“When you improve a little each day, eventually big things occur. When you improve conditioning a little each day, eventually you have a big improvement in conditioning. Not tomorrow, not the next day, but eventually a big gain is made. Don’t look for the big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at a time. That’s the only way it happens — and when it happens, it lasts.” — John Wooden

Becoming 1% better every day is a simple, practical way to achieve big goals. 1% seems like a small amount. Yes, it is. It’s tiny. It’s easy. It’s doable. And it’s applicable in most things you want to do or accomplish.

It feels less intimidating and is more manageable. It might feel less exciting than chasing a huge win, but its results will be stronger and more sustainable.


Many people practically look out for secrets, tricks, and hacks that will make EVERYTHING better right now. But unfortunately life doesn’t work that way. There are no “overnight successes”. Think of all the incredible people you truly admire. They didn’t succeed becasue of one giant move, but rather a series of small and consistent actions over time.

A magic bullet cannot save you! You’ve got to embrace the process and enjoy it. You can’t escape the hard work it takes to get better. Every incredibly successful person you know today has been through the boring, mundane, time-tested process that eventually brings success. So, stop looking for “quick hacks” that bring faster results.





Focus on intentions rather than goals. As you might know, I experimented with giving up goals after being very focused on goals for years. It was liberating, and it turns out, you don’t just do nothing if you don’t have a goal. You get up and focus on what you care about. Read more here. Instead, I’ve found it useful to focus less on the destination (goal) and instead focus on what your intention for each activity is. If you’re going to write something … instead of worrying about what the book will be like when you’re done, focus on why you want to write in the first place. If you are doing something out of love or to help others , for example, then you are freed from it needing to turn out a certain way (a goal) and instead can let it turn out however it turns out. I’ve found this way of working and living to be freeing and less prone to anxiety or procrastination.
Small actions really add up. By focusing on getting out and going for a run each day, I ran several marathons and eventually an ultramarathon. By writing a blog post or part of a book chapter every day, I’ve written well over a thousand blog posts and many books, articles and courses. Small actions every day can really add up to a mountain.




But when you create a routine, stick to the routine, and grind it out, day after day after day, you can get there. And every day you get to feel good about yourself, because you accomplished what you set out to accomplish that day.

That daily success -- and the intrinsic reward that comes with it -- is incredibly motivating. It creates a virtuous cycle that makes it easier to do what you need to do tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, until one day you lift up your head and realize you've accomplished what that once seemed impossible -- maybe especially to you.

Try it. Pick a business or personal goal you want to accomplish. Break it down into daily activities. If you want to grow your business, call five prospects every day. If you want to build your network, connect with three people every day. If you want build better relationships, check in with one friend or family member every day.

What you decide to do is up to you; just make sure you create a routine that gets you to what currently seems like an insurmountable finish line.

Then all you have to do is stick to that routine. If you do, success is assured.


If I was in my 20s and early 30s, using a roboadvisor to invest 20%+ of my after tax, after 401k maximum contribution is exactly what I would be doing. I wasted too much time trying to pick individual positions that either didn’t make money, distracted me from my job, and/or gave me a lot of stress when I was younger.

Building wealth is all about having a regular contribution system over a long period of time. Allocate no more than 10% of your investable assets to trying to pick individual stocks if you must. The biggest problem retail investors have is not knowing how to manage risk.


entirely new approach to living your life. Goals are milestones along that new path. Having a goal may be a nice way to measure your progress, but the end result should be to keep your new habits even when you reach them.

I think a lot of people are highly motivated when they set goals and probably have a lot of success when they get started on the goal. But Jim Ryun (a three-time Olympic runner and the first high schooler to ever break 4 minutes in the mile) has a great quote about this – “Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.” I love that.


But most of all, here’s the thing with goals: you’re never satisfied. Goals are a way of saying, “When I’ve accomplished this goal (or all these goals), I will be happy then. I’m not happy now, because I haven’t achieved my goals.” This is never said out loud, but it’s what goals really mean. The problem is, when we achieve the goals, we don’t achieve happiness. We set new goals, strive for something new.

do what excites me. Each day. I wake up, and work on things that I’m passionate about, create things that I love creating.

I don’t worry about where I’ll be (professionally) in a year or even six months, but where I am right now.




 We tend to focus on the end product of our goal and define success as getting to that end point. Instead, make the process your focus and define success in those terms. Here�s how James Clear puts it:


But if you look at the people who are consistently achieving their goals, you start to realize that it�s not the events or the results that make them different. It�s their commitment to the process. They fall in love with the daily practice, not the individual event.


Fall in love with boredom. Fall in love with repetition and practice. Fall in love with the process of what
you do and let the results take care of themselves.




Goals are nice. Habits are better.

We all have things that we want to achieve in our lives — getting into the better shape, building a successful business, raising a wonderful family, writing a best-selling book, winning a championship, and so on.

And for most of us, the path to those things starts by setting a specific and actionable goal. At least, this is how I approached my life until recently. I would set goals for classes I took, for weights that I wanted to lift in the gym, and for clients I wanted in my business.

What I’m starting to realize, however, is that when it comes to actually getting things done and making progress in the areas that are important to you, there is a much better way to do things.

It all comes down to the difference between goals and systems.

Let me explain.

The Difference Between Goals and Systems

What’s the difference between goals and systems?

If you’re a coach, your goal is to win a championship. Your system is what your team does at practice each day.
If you’re a writer, your goal is to write a book. Your system is the writing schedule that you follow each week.
If you’re a runner, your goal is to run a marathon. Your system is your training schedule for the month.
If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal is to build a million dollar business. Your system is your sales and marketing process.
Now for the really interesting question:

If you completely ignored your goals and focused only on your system, would you still get results?

What I did focus on was writing one article every Monday and Thursday. And after sticking to that schedule for 11 months, the result was 115,000 words. I focused on my system and the process of doing the work. In the end, I enjoyed the same (or perhaps better) results.

1. Goals reduce your current happiness.
When you’re working toward a goal, you are essentially saying, “I’m not good enough yet, but I will be when I reach my goal.”

The problem with this mindset is that you’re teaching yourself to always put happiness and success off until the next milestone is achieved. “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy. Once I achieve my goal, then I’ll be successful.”

SOLUTION: Commit to a process, not a goal.

Choosing a goal puts a huge burden on your shoulders. Can you imagine if I had made it my goal to write two books this year? Just writing that sentence stresses me out.

But we do this to ourselves all the time. We place unnecessary stress on ourselves to lose weight or to succeed in business or to write a best-selling novel. Instead, you can keep things simple and reduce stress by focusing on the daily process and sticking to your schedule, rather than worrying about the big, life-changing goals.

When you focus on the practice instead of the performance, you can enjoy the present moment and improve at the same time.

Consider someone training for a half-marathon. Many people will work hard for months, but as soon as they finish the race, they stop training. Their goal was to finish the half-marathon and now that they have completed it, that goal is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it?

Fall In Love With Systems

None of this is to say that goals are useless. However, I’ve found that goals are good for planning your progress and systems are good for actually making progress.

Goals can provide direction and even push you forward in the short-term, but eventually a well-designed system will always win. Having
 a system is what matters. Committing to the process is what makes the difference.


 Basically, I used small, everyday habits to build up into big, long-term outcomes.

There are four principles I try to stick to whenever I’m building a new habit. Through everything I’ve tried, these are the principles that seem to work every time.
1. Start Small: Repeat A Tiny Habit Daily
2. 2. Focus On One Habit At A Time

So my new rule is to work on just one habit at a time. Only when that habit is so automatic I can do it every day easily do I start on a new habit.

 Remove Barriers: Have Everything You Need At Hand

I find it much easier to complete my habits when the equipment I need is at hand. For instance, having my phone in my hand already while drinking coffee made it easier to build a habit of doing a quick French lesson at that time. Reading a page of a book every night became a lot easier when I kept the book by my bed.

Malcolm Gladwell calls this the tipping point. It’s that small change that tips you over from making excuses to taking action. One great example of the power of a tipping point comes from a study of tetanus education at a university. The study tested whether trying to induce higher levels of fear about tetanus would encourage more students to get vaccinated against it. The fear level of the education program didn’t seem to make any difference, but one surprising change did: adding a map of the university campus showing the health center and the times vaccinations were available increased the vaccination rate from 3% to 28%.

The tipping point is that tiny change that makes it easy enough to take action that you’ll actually follow through. I like to think of it as removing any barriers that make it easy to not follow through on my habits.

4. Stack Habits: Build New Routines Onto Existing Ones

One of my favorite ways to build new habits is to stack them onto existing habits. This builds up several habits into a routine, and each habit acts as a trigger for the next one.
