Developers: When Is Planning Enough?


As an example, many years ago, I was working as a VP of software development. Some of the first XP teams in that company discovered the benefits of continuous integration, and I was excited to spread this practice across the department. I could have appointed someone to make that happen.

Instead, at the next department meeting, I talked about how impressed I was with what those teams had done, and how it was going to be important for us to spread that good practice to other teams. Without explicitly saying so, I let it be known that this was something people could work on.

Of course, for this to work, leaders also need to create a culture in which employees do not have every waking moment of every day committed to project work. Companies don't need to go so far as the well-known Google 20 percent time, but employees should generally have some time they devote to work of their own choosing.

This is a sign that leaders trust employees. It is also a recognition that it is impossible for a leader or manager to identify the highest priority work in all cases.

If you're a leader in an agile organization, the next time you need something done, rather than assigning someone to the work, consider creating a vacuum and seeing who steps into it.
