Work Hard
02-





There are so many people in the world that are so much more talented than you.

They¿re sexier. Smarter. Richer. More creative. More likable, more charming, better-connected, and better-looking.

But there is one, singular thing you can do better than them:

You can outwork them.

This sheer commitment to keep-going-no-matter-what beats your stronger opponent, every time.

Prolific actor Will Smith was once asked how he got to be so successful in his career:

¿The only thing that I see that is distinctly different about me is I¿m not afraid to die on a treadmill. I will not be out-worked, period. You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me, you might be all of those things. But if we get on the treadmill together, there¿s two things: You¿re getting off first, or I¿m going to die.¿
Anybody can cultivate this discipline.









Hustle is for amateurs. Here are 8 reasons why (and what you should do to go pro).

Hustle measures input. Pros measure output.

You get what you measure. ¿ Anonymous


I hate listening to insecure high achievers try to one-up each other about who is hustling more.

There is no prize for hustle. We work for results.

In the early stages of pursuing a goal, you may not have much to show for your work, and that¿s fine. But even here, celebrate the tasks you complete. Not how little you sleep or how long you work.

Inefficiency is not something to brag about.

¿Dude, I stayed up all night writing a blog post. I could barely keep my eyes open. #Hustle¿

That¿s absurd. ^^

Try this ¿

¿Dude, I got a good night¿s sleep and wrote a blog post in one hour this morning. #Efficient¿

How to Go Pro: Don¿t measure how hard you work. Measure how much you get done.







And then she said something we can all learn from.

ÒIÕve been dreaming of a moment like this since I was a little girl,Ó she said. ÒIt means a lot to me, to my family. Hopefully it inspires the next generation of women to just be patient. It took me seven years to do this. A lot of hard work went into this one moment.Ó

Everyone wants to be successful. Of course, your definition of success can and should be different Ñ because success should mean something different to each of us Ñ but still: We all want to succeed at whatever we choose to do. (Otherwise, why do it?)

Success is often based on outworking other people Ñ both in terms of effort and hours spent. Yet success is also based on patience. Staying the course. Perseverance is absolutely critical.

You canÕt be there at the end if you arenÕt actually there at the end.

You canÕt always control timing. You canÕt always control any number of factors. But what can you always control?

How hard you work and how long you work.

You may not be smarter than everyone else. You may not be as talented. You may not have the same great connections, the same great environment, or the same great education. If youÕre on the downside of advantage, you may have none of those things.

But you can always rely on your courage, your effort, and your patience. You can always substitute effort for skill and experience, secure in the knowledge that, over time, incredible effort will breed skill and experience.

Hard work. Patience.

You can always, always, always work harder Ñ and longer Ñ than everyone else.

And you can always be patient: Both with yourself, and with others.



The Core Principles Of Financial Samurai
1) Never fail due to a lack of effort because effort requires no skill. You can fail because of superior competition, bad luck, or poor execution, but you cannot fail because you didn¿t try your best. When you look back on your life, your biggest regrets will be the things you didn¿t do and the things you half-assed. Get on that 6am bus!

2) Always maintain an abundance mindset instead of a scarcity mindset. There are trillions of dollars in the world for the taking. There is no reason why you can¿t build your own fortune. Focus on wealth creation through investing and entrepreneurship rather than just being frugal. There is only so much you can save and an endless amount you can make.

3) Depend on no one but yourself to succeed. Nobody will save you, so you must save yourself. The world can be a very difficult place. We will inevitably face hardships along our path to financial independence. Most people are too busy fighting their own fires to help fight yours. By accepting that nobody will bail us out, we will end up doing our best work because we have no other choice.

4) Know that you only deserve what you have earned. There is no better feeling than working hard for your success. Pity the people who have everything given to them. Let go of your need to compare. You will never fully know how hard they tried or didn¿t try to achieve their results. Eradicate entitlement.

5) Always give without asking for anything in return. Give your time. Give your money. Give your kindness to those in need. You never know what someone is going through, so keep your judgement locked away. Constantly smile and you will find that strangers will smile right back. Eventually, people can¿t help but want to help you succeed.



6) Live a life of purpose as soon as possible. Financial Samurais do not just sit passively and let life beat them up. Instead, they take action to make life better, no matter how uncomfortable the path. No job is worth doing if you don¿t give it at least a 7 out of 10. Take career risks. Start a business on the side. Constantly be exploring new opportunities. Never settle.




A Focused Passion for Hard Work
There are no half measures for Japanese marathoners. And where many western elites blame genetic predisposition for not being able to achieve a breakthrough, such thinking doesnÕt occur amongst the Japanese professional marathoners. Hashizume quotes coach Nakamura as evidence of this truism: ÒNatural talent has limits; but thereÕs no limit to hard work.Ó Hashizume suggests that Japanese runners still cling to their dreams. ÒWhile some young westerners seek some scientific proof whether or not itÕs Ôworth trying,Õ Japanese still hold, sometimes rather silly old-fashioned ÔromanticÕ view that lots of hard work can overcome lack of natural talent.Ó


There's nothing more vaunted in sports than giving your all. Never mind that this judgment is often totally superficialÑgrimacing uncontrollably and sweating buckets have no inherent moral value. 


i went through a period where i was like, this is really hard and everyone says it gets better over time, why am i going backward?

So how¿d she climb the ranks so fast? Two words: hard work.

¿Nothing in life is handed to you,¿ she says. ¿If you want to achieve success, go out and get it. To accomplish what you desire, no matter what it is, you have to be willing to put in the time and effort. If you have the work ethic and the drive, you will succeed.¿

Something else King attributes her success to is a willingness to sacrifice. While her peers were out partying in high school, she resisted. ¿I never really followed the social norms a teenage girl often follows, because I was always so focused on what I ultimately wanted," she says. ;;;wq




Want it more than anything else
It goes without saying that accruing significant wealth at a young age requires focus, but the sheer amount of dedication can be too much for some to bear.

ÒYou have to really want it. A lot of people say they want, but they donÕt really want it,Ó Sabatier said of the effort required in becoming a millionaire. ÒYou have to cancel your Netflix subscription and stay off Instagram and focus on building a business. You have to be willing to spend your extra time learning and pushing yourself. Read business books, listen to podcasts, or take a free online course instead of watching Netflix. Focus on investing in yourself and your skills. Slowly youÕll start seeing money-making opportunities in places youÕve never seen before.Ó

Pleasure Vs. Happiness
¿A life that doesn¿t include hard-won accomplishment and triumph over obstacles may not be a satisfying one. There is something deeply fulfilling¿¿¿even thrilling¿¿¿in doing almost anything difficult extremely well. There is a joy and pride that come from pushing yourself to another level or across a new frontier. A life devoted only to the present¿¿¿to feeling good in the now¿¿¿is unlikely to deliver real fulfillment. The present moment by itself it too small, too hollow. We all need a future. Something beyond and greater than our own present gratification, at which to aim or feel we¿ve contributed.¿¿¿¿The Triple Package
True happiness¿¿¿joy¿¿¿is fundamentally different than momentary pleasure. Not to say momentary pleasure is inherently bad. However, it often gets in the way of something more real and lasting.
Anything worth doing brings a satisfaction that distraction never can. Don¿t give into the resistance. Push through the difficulty. That¿s where a joy that those who stop will never taste.

I had caught some bug that was going around. With little energy to do anything, I ended up watching the entire season of Westworld Ñ all 10 hours of it Ñ in a single day. By the way, I loved the show Ñ it felt like a role-playing game that mixed Jurassic Park and humanoid robots, all infused with an awesome storyline, great character development, and unpredictable plot twists.

Binge-watching a TV show isnÕt something I usually do. Afterwards, I felt a little guilty.

Growing up in an immigrant family, with parents who have always worked six-day weeks, a hard work ethic has always been part of my identity. I often feel guilty whenever IÕm wasting time or not being productive. IÕll ask myself, ÒIs this really the best use of the opportunity I have?Ó

5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Say yes to everything. Show up early. Introduce yourself to everyone. It's that simple. Show up to every conference, go out to drinks with your friends in the industry, engage, and be active in the community. Life is all about who you know. And I can tell you that you won't get to know anyone if you aren't out and about. You never know when you'll cross paths with the right people. Hustle, hustle, hustle. We are a make-up of our choices. Every day you have the choice to wake up and be damn good at what you do, and you also have the choice to make it by on the bare minimum.



No alternative for hard work 
Richards-Kortum sees parallels between her work in the lab and training for marathons, adding that a lot of success in both of those endeavors is about showing up every day, refusing to give up, and following through on every detail.

ÒTaking the long view is really important,Ó she said. ÒYou really have to think about whatÕs it going to take to go the distance, and there is no substitute for doing the training, especially when youÕre 52.Ó


so close to me that I almost had to veer to avoid bumping into it. ¿WHO VANTS IT?,¿ the head yelled. Before the race, he had explained to me that if I wanted to do well, I would have to¿here he clenched his fist and grimaced¿¿Unggggh.¿ It was a sound of deep, existential suffering, and I got the point. But after another second or two, his question hit home, and I realized that I did, in fact, want it very, very badly. I stopped glancing over my shoulder, looked ahead, and slowly but surely managed to reel in the leader just before the finish.

Great lives often include a collection of unbelievable stories. But they are not merely a collection of unbelievable stories. A great life is forged and created in the shadows of them. As Muhammad Ali once put it, "The fight is won or lost far away from witnesses¿¿¿behind the lines, in the gym, and out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights."

The moments that lead to greatness are the ones that pass when no one is watching, when no one cares and when nothing is on the line. Maximizing these moments as opportunities are what lead to excellence. Just as football teams practice during the week to win on game day, humans train daily to capitalize on opportunities when presented with them.

The vast majority of life is spent out of the watchful eye of those who depend on you, cheer for you or work against you. Most moments when we eat, sleep, dream, do, fritter, rest, talk and zone out are done so at our leisure and done unchecked without intention. There's so much time available to waste¿¿¿if we choose to. If we expertly use these spare moments that mean nothing to our advantage, we can unlock valuable¿¿¿yet, seemingly hidden¿¿¿levels of achievement.






4. Never forget to be last.

Everyone likes to be first. But often it's better to be last: the last to give up, the last to leave, the last to keep trying, the last to hold on to principles and values.

The world is full of people who quit. The world is full of people who pivot -- even though pivot is sometimes just a fancy word for "give up."

There will always be people who are smarter, more talented, better connected, and better funded. But they don't always win.

Be the last to give up on yourself; then, even if you don't succeed, you still win.





2. Recognize that a talent deficit can be overcome with hard work and self-awareness

OK, so you chase your dream career and find out that, well, you're good, but not especially great, at it. Take heart, says Belichick, from the example of Tom Brady, who, to put it plainly, "is not a great natural athlete ... not even close."

"But nobody's worked harder than Tom," Belichick says. "He's trained hard. He's worked hard on his throwing mechanics, on his mental understanding of the game. He's earned everything he's achieved."





When you are working your hardest, are you working toward your own goals or somebody elseÕs goals? Many of us go to work and plod forward on a path we didnÕt choose.

When you are in head-down, nose-to-the-grindstone mode you are only working, and not thinking broadly.

You are not imagining possibilities then. You are not allowing your mind to wander and come up with impossible, incredible, world-changing ideas when your focus is simply Òworking hardÓ or Òknocking down the items on my To-Do list.Ó

Your To-Do list will always be there, and it will never get any shorter.

The more items you tick off your To-Do list, the more items will appear. Obviously working hard on your To-Do list is not the path to success Ñ so what is?

The path to success leads in a different direction.

Yes, it will require hard work to realize your vision, but itÕs not the kind of hard work that involves working your tail off to get a promotion or a raise or a good performance review.

What difference do those things make?

This is your lifetime.

You get to decide how to make your mark on this planet. The first step on your path to success is to stop working, stop stressing, and let your mind wander.

Some people do it on a bicycle or in the tub. They take off their mental shackles and ask ÒIf it were totally up to me, what would I do with my life?Ó

It is totally up to you. For many people, thatÕs the scary part!





Bill Gates said, ÒMost people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.Ó 



5) What itÕs all for at the end of the day. I know plenty of high earning people who are not happy because they are stressed at work and can never spend as much time with the people they love. Not only that, they know the work theyÕre doing isnÕt really helping society so they feel theyÕre selling their souls. They canÕt leave due to an unhealthy desire for prestige, money, and power. Realize thereÕs a wonderful life beyond just making lots of money. Seek your happiness before you look back on life full of regret.


If you have a job, consider yourself lucky and treat your job as if you won the lottery. Do not complain about a crappy bonus or a lack of promotion when so many people would do anything to be in your shoes.

Whenever I got yelled at by a client or boss or had to travel thousands of miles for a one hour long meeting, Id remember back to my high school days and smile. I had this immense fear that if I did not do well in school, I would end up flipping burgers in the morning, stuffing envelopes in the afternoon, and moving boxes at night for a living.

Nowadays, writing three to four times a week online is a piece of cake compared to all jobs Ive held prior. Whenever I start to feel burnt out or sorry for myself, I laugh at how silly I am and think, How the hell can you get burnt out sitting in the hot tub writing a post? Dont you remember your past? Stop complaining! I sometimes get lazy and need all the motivation I can get to carry on.

I encourage everyone to work a minimum wage job growing up or find a job you might feel is beneath you at some point in your life. Once you experience craptasticity, you will not only appreciate everyone who currently works such jobs, youll also become much more appreciative of what you have.




Most great things in your life wont happen by CHANCE. They'll happen by CHOICE. Figure out what you want, and work your butt off for it.



IÕm 27 years old.

IÕm in my prime right now. But my prime isnÕt going to last forever.

IÕm not looking to coast. Just going through the motions isnÕt something IÕll ever be comfortable with.

I have big goals.

I want to be the best player in the United States É the best player in the world.



you are rewarded for the work you actually accomplish. Not the promises you make.



Persistence isn't about trying the same tactics over and over. It's about having the same goal each time. 


Moderation is usually just an excuse to be average You don¿t get into amazing shape by drinking moderate amounts of alcohol, eating moderate amounts of junk food, and exercising moderately a couple times a week. You don¿t become a billionaire by working 40 hours a week. Extreme results require extreme efforts.

Anything worth doing is difficult. It will require courage and strength from you; otherwise, it¿s probably not worth doing.





It doesnÕt translate well into the stories of people who were successful because they Òworked hard.Ó Did they work plenty of hours? For sure. But the determining factor in their success is not hours. ItÕs courage.

If weÕre seeking to be more productive the proper order in which to organize our resources is, first, courage, then wisdom, and, finally, labor. Committing to something and being willing to fail, to get hit, will pay off more than another twenty hours a week or another productivity hack.

ItÕs an ironic paradox because by choosing to focus on many things, we guarantee that none will work. In committing to many things, we commit to failure. Because we are unwilling to commit to a single thing, we donÕt give anything the attention it deserves and all our projects fail.

And so, the choice is either commit to one thing and make success more likely, or commit to many things make success less likely. In our search for definiteness, for certainty, we sabotage our chances.

More than that, we often try to compensate for an unwillingness to commit with working harder. Instead of firing the team member who is dragging down the project, we work harder to make up for her. Firing her takes courage. It is emotional work.

In The 80/20 Principle, Richard Koch gives the example of a high school boy walking up to a high school girl and asking her on a date as an example of the 80/20 principle in action. Instead of going around and talking to all her friends and seeing what they think sheÕll say, then composing a letter, then worrying about it, just walk up to her and ask her on the date. ThatÕs courage, thatÕs the 80/20 in action.



Ali "the fight is won or lost far away from witnesses-behind the lines, in the gym, and out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights"

I do not believe people want a handout. Instead, people want to feel useful, whether it¿s teaching a child right from wrong, to doing something as simple as maintaining a lovely garden. People want to earn their worth. I believe losing a sense of purpose is the main reason why some studies show that some early retirees tend to die sooner.

There is no shortcut to anywhere worth going.  There is no substitute for doing the work.   You must run to be a runner.  You must write to be a writer.  You must actively attend to your relationships if you want them to flourish.


Visualize the life you want to lead and work on making it a reality, one day at a time.  You don¿t have to work toward achieving everything that you want at once; just establish what your key goal is today, and work on that.  Once you¿ve got that one under control, start working on the next one.

You never know whether you could have put in the effort and done something incredible with your life.  I made changes because I was sick of not knowing.  What about you?

Find the courage to do the hard things in life.  The things no one else is doing.  The things that frighten you.  The things others can¿t do for you.  The things that make you question how much longer you can hold on and push forward.  Because those are the things that define you.  Those are the things that make the difference between existing and living ¿ between knowing the path and walking the path ¿ between a life of mediocrity and a life filled with happiness and success.

It is what you do each day that truly matters. You can have big dreams and have the skills and the knowledge. However, if you donÕt have the habits to practice it daily, you will never grow and accumulate small successes that will amass over time.

Great results are built from small actions that you take every day. It is your habits that will determine who you are and what you can accomplish in the future.

If you suffer from money guilt, I think the best thing you can do is honor the opportunities you have. DonÕt waste them because there are literally millions of people out there who donÕt have the same chances. Work your hardest until you pass out on your desk. Take more risks because others canÕt afford to. Accept financial assistance with humility and figure out a way to honor the helper. Find ways to give back. Sooner or later the guilt will be replaced with fulfillment. IÕll let you know when my feelings change.

Never be satisfied, always look to improve


"You think this was going to be easy?" Bosh says. "What, they're just going to hand us a championship? That's not going to happen. Of course that's not going to happen. We forgot. We probably shouldn't even say we're back-to-back champs. Would we feel different about it, would we have a different hunger if Kawhi Leonard makes a free throw? If Manu [Ginobili] boxes me out?"

"It's hard," Bosh says. "Just to have to get back on track to do the same thing again for the fourth time. You know what's ahead. You know it's a hell of a mountain to climb. It's like, man, I don't want to do this, not yet. Your body is telling you that you can't do it. You have every reason not to do it. That's what makes it really tough. There's a reason why not many teams have three-peated, let alone won a championship. It's really hard."

In hindsight, it looks as if the projects that I was most passionate about were also the ones that worked. But objectively, my passion level moved with my success. Success caused passion more than passion caused success. - Scott Adams 

Guilt makes me work harder than perhaps I need to because I never feel like I deserve anything. I was just lucky and lucky is not an admirable trait

1. Decide what you want.
2. Decide what you are willing to exchange for it.
3. Establish your priorities.
4. Get to work.

Remember, the real world doesnât reward perfectionists.  It rewards people who get things done.  And the only way to get things done is to be imperfect 99% of the time.  Only by wading through years of practice and imperfection can we begin to achieve momentary glimpses of the perfection.  So make a decision.  Take action, learn from the outcome, and repeat this method over and over again in all walks of life.

As they round into their thirties, they find themselves working in jobs doing something very different than they hoped, usually for less money, and usually in fields they arenât really passionate about. What happened?

I think they were lied to. You canât be anything you want to be.

Growing up, many of the people around them told them they could be anything they want to be when they grow up. That they should do what they love and the money will follow. That above all, they should do whatever makes them happy. And yet they look at their lives and find it hasnât worked out the way they planned. They werenât lied to on purpose, of course. But they were lied to nonetheless.

Itâs understandable. Many of the people doling out this advice watched their parents work jobs they hated, come home exhausted, and have very little energy to spend on their families. But I worry that they swung too far in the other direction.

We started to emphasize passion over discipline. Dreaming over doing. Positivity over pragmatism. And the end result was we became people convinced we get to do whatever we want, even if nobody wants it and even if weâre not particularly qualified to do it.

Hereâs what we should have been told instead, and what I plan on telling my son.

The market doesnât care what you love

There are many noble and critically important professions, but there arenât unlimited roles in those professions. Itâs awesome so many people want to teach our kids, but if 100 million people decided they wanted to become teachers, it doesnât mean the market is obligated to provide 100 million teaching jobs. Itâs not a moral or systematic failure on the part of society. While teaching struggles, nursing is growing like crazy. Itâs supply and demand in action..

You must create value

Nobody owes you anything. Just because you have a degree doesnât mean someone is required to give you a job. You must demonstrate you can create value for people, or else theyâll find another person or method to get things done.

Creating value means learning things other people donât know. It means doing things other people arenât willing to do. It sometimes means working for free to demonstrate youâre capable of performing. It means taking on tasks no one else wants and turning them into something better. It means working harder than everyone else.

It means demonstrating youâre worth keeping around and worth paying for.

What our kids will know

I think our children will probably learn from our lives. I think theyâll pursue more degrees with practical applications. I think theyâll be extremely entrepreneurial, and will recognize the world changes too fast to stop learning and growing. And I think theyâll know there is no short cut to getting what they want â they have to work really hard for it.

Nearly everything that generates enduring value requires effort, focus, and even some discomfort along the way.  At the same time, were deeply wired to avoid pain, which the body reads as mortally dangerous, and to move toward pleasure, the more immediate the better.

Were also exposed to more temptation than ever. The world is literally at our fingertips, a few keystrokes away. Its forever beckoning us, like the Sirens singing to Odysseus, who lashed himself to the mast of his ship to resist their call.The sirens sing to us, too: Have the dessert. Skip the workout. Put off the hard work. Surf the web. Check your email. Indulge your whims. Settle for the easy way out.

So how do we take back control of our lives?  What follows are the key moves we can make. Its not all or none.  More is better, but each one will help.

ItÕs a natural weakness of the human brain that we donÕt recognize this, because we have our leftover instincts of survival in the moment. But a ten dollar lunch each workday compounds to $37,600 every ten years. An extra beer or slice of bread beyond your base calorie requirements adds up to 152 pounds of fat* over the same period. A habit of being just a bit rude to your spouse in certain situations can brew itself into lifelong resentment and divorce, while a slightly different habit of patience and respect can keep you happily married for life.


ThereÕs only one problem with working so long and so hard for your money. Sooner or later you will lose your motivation no matter how in tune you are with society. YouÕll start believing that you deserve everything youÕve got. YouÕll begin to take ridiculous amounts of vacation because what do you care about work?

Someday you will look back on your life and realize that everything worthwhile you¿ve ever accomplished initially challenged you.  

4. Luck is the worst thing to wish for.

Why? The things you earn are infinitely more gratifying.

If you saved up to buy your first car you know exactly what Im talking about. If you worked and hustled and saved and finally had enough to buy your car, you appreciated it. You took care of it. It was yours, both practically and emotionally.

If you were given a car, that was pretty coolbut you didnt really feel anything. (Except possibly gratitude.)

If you want to wish for something, wish for the strength and perseverance to earn the things you want. Dont wait for luck to bring you that enabling client; work your butt off to land that enabling client.

That way youll not only enjoy the destination, youll appreciate and be fulfilled by the journey.

Sometimes the greatest dreams that come true are the dreams you never even knew you had.  ItÕs about open-minded exploration.  There are no wrong turns in life, only paths you didnÕt know you were meant to walk.  You never can be certain whatÕs around the corner.  It could be everything, or it could be nothing.  You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and realize youÕve climbed to the peak of the most beautiful mountaintop.

10. Celebrate small wins.

We all are so busy and our minds so problem-focused, we tend to rush from one thing to the next and miss the progress we are making. ÒYet a sense of progress has been shown to be one of the most rewarding and engaging experiences at work,Ó says Rock. ÒTake time out regularly Ñ weekly or monthly is ideal Ñ to celebrate the wins and the progress you have made on your goals. Positive emotions are helpful on many levels, including improving immune function and making us more creative.Ó

Take positive action. Ð DonÕt sit back and let things happen to you.  Go out and happen to things.  You are what you do, not what you say youÕll do.  Stop saying ÒI wishÓ and start saying ÒI will.Ó  Turn your cantÕs into cans and your dreams into plans.


t's Not the Event, It's the ProcessP

All too often, we think our goals are all about the result. We see success as an event that can be achieved and completed.P

Here are some common examples¿P

Many people see health as an event: "If I just lose 20 pounds, then I'll be in shape."P
Many people see entrepreneurship as an event: "If we could get our business featured in the New York Times, then we'd be set."P
Many people see art as an event: "If I could just get my work featured in a bigger gallery, then I'd have the credibility I need."P
Those are just a few of the many ways that we categorize success as a single event.P

But if you look at the people who are consistently achieving their goals, you start to realize that it's not the events or the results that make them different. It's their commitment to the process. They fall in love with the daily practice, not the individual event.P


If you want to be in the best shape of your life, then losing 20 pounds might be necessary. But the only way to reach that result is to fall in love with the process of eating healthy and exercising consistently.P

If you want to become significantly better at anything, you have to fall in love with the process of doing it. You have to fall in love with building the identity of someone who does the work, rather than merely dreaming about the results that you want.P

In other words¿P

Fall in love with boredom. Fall in love with repetition and practice. Fall in love with the process of what you do and let the results take care of themselves.P

Certainly, changing the habit of laziness into the habit of high productivity and industriousness takes work. If mental toughness were easy, everybody would succeed all of the time.

Part of mental toughness is understanding that the only true obstacles in life are self-imposed. You always have the choice to overcome and rise above. You have the choice to see yourself not as lazy, but as energetic, focused, and driven.



1. Discover New Skills

When you fully apply yourself at work you begin to realize that you can do more than you ever thought possible. You discover skills that you may have never used before or even recognized. You never know what you are capable of until you start doing it.
