Obsession with points

There are many murky things about story points, but somehow the scrum masters and coaches will not abandon it. First of all, what are story points? Are they measures of time it takes to complete a story? If yes, then why are they not in terms of time? Are they measures of complexity? If yes, why are we not talking of the complexity of stories, and how we can remove them, instead of how we can achieve as many points as possible? That is, shouldn't we be talking about doing as few points as possible? The best measure I have heard is effort. You can work three hours on half effort, but work hard for an hour and finish a task, which explains why it's not about time.

No matter how you define story points, the real issue with them doesn't go away. The main purpose of points is making planning more reliable, and providing a temporal perspective for business. They never fail to take on a life of their own, however, with teams working to gather points instead of delivering good software. I don't understand why points are special compared to the oft-mocked cases of bug hunts or lines of code written. If devs are measured on points, they will optimize on points. Has the code base improved? Did it become more modular, simpler, 




The daily standup deserves a blog post of its own. This religious ritual has become a staple of every team in the world. Ten minutes of staring into the void, talking about what you did while no one else listens, because they were in the middle of something five minutes ago and will go back to it in another five minutes, and waiting for everyone else to finish. I know this sounds cynical, but it is the end result of asking people to do it every freaking day. Nowadays devs are communicating on all kinds of channels (email, Slack, Github/Gitlab, ticketing system) and tracking detailed progress on some of these. What's the point in having them stand around for another ten minutes to repeat a few standard sentences? 


You may find the same thing with modern agile: discovering you don't need something you once thought was so valuable.
I once thought that story point estimates, calculating velocity and fixed-length time boxes (A.K.A. sprints or iterations) were essential, yet now I use none of them in my agile practice.

Modern agile simplifies and streamlines traditional agile processes while making them sturdier.

For example, Continuous Deployment requires a dependable release pipeline by which you can rapidly and safely deliver value to users.

Kanban helps people focus on flowing value to users rather than getting bogged down in outdated, traditional planning rituals.

Test & Refactor

Testing and design are essential to agility. Modern agilists perform exploratory testing, automated testing, test-driven development (which is primarily a design activity, and secondarily a testing activity), and some manual testing. One quantitative study of modern agile communities trained and coached in testing and refactoring by Industrial Logic found that defects dropped by over 80%. By producing dependable, high-speed, automated checks of software behavior, programmers have a safety net that allows them to work faster, with less fear of changing code or producing defects. Refactoring (improving the design of existing code without changing behavior) is a critical practice to keeping design complexity at bay and making code simple and understandable (and therefore easier to change). Refactoring is revision, which in latin means to re-see (re-videre). We revise things as we learn more, discover flaws in our earlier work and endeavor to improve the design/readability/simplicity of our code. Both testing and refactoring are essential to a team's speed and are therefore a critical part of modern agile.

Focus on Flow

Modern agile prefers continuous flow over working in time boxes (e.g. sprints or iterations). Kanban enables continuous flow. Using a kanban board, teams visualize their work on a board, pull important work across columns, limit work in process, support classes of service (e.g. urgent or normal work), visualize and remove bottlenecks and flow value to users in production. You don't spend time trying to predict how much work you can do during a time box, accounting for the exact number of storypoints or trying to look good by publishing an attractive burn-down or burn-up chart. This is streamlined agile planning. David J Anderson describes it beautifully in his pivotal book, Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business.

Deploy & Release Continuously

Kent Beck once pointed me to a stunning video by Timothy Fitz called "Doing The Impossible 50 Times A Day." (Alas, a hapless ISP lost Timothy's awesome video, but he wrote a blog about it). Timothy described how IMVU (the birthplace of Lean Startup) took the practice of Continuous Integration (CI) far further than early agilists had conceived by safely deploying to production many times per day. The CI dial had been turned to 11. Continuous Deployment powers early, fast experimentation in production (e.g. A/B tests) and allows you to rapidly and safely deliver what users most need as fast as possible. It's one of my favorite lean-influenced practices because it dramatically reduces the "Concept to Cash" cycle. Timothy Fitz authored a CD eLearning course with Industrial Logic and is presently writing a book on this modern agile practice. Jez Humble and David Farley are deep experts in the practice and authors of Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation.

Along the way, some of the agile fundamentals got lost.

Embracing change is one of them, especially when it comes to improving your process.

Like Apple's hardware designers, modern agile innovators fearlessly questioned sacred cows, experimented with new processes, recorded successes and failures and carefully crafted better ways of working.

Modern agile is the result of courage, feedback, simplicity, communication and respect for people.


 What are your release bottlenecks and what will help you flow value to users faste




 Scrum is usually the first and sometimes the only Agile process some teams adopt, because unlike Agile principles, it is a tangible process that can be implemented in a short time. In its crudest form, it just adds a few more meetings and splits work into multiple deliveries. Teams who adopt the crudest form will find themselves complaining about long and tedious meetings. Instead of a “sustainable pace”, teams find themselves having to “sprint” in each iteration to get something ready for review.

It is not Scrum’s fault per se. However, since many Agile consultants sell Scrum as the de facto Agile process, resulting in teams adopting the crudest form, we have to face the fact that Scrum may have done more harm than good, and understand why it is so. If you argue that it is not the true Scrum (just like when Agile fails, it is not the true Agile), just replace Scrum with Scrum preached by bad Agile consultants.
