I'm A Fraud
11-01-2014




Developers are frauds.

At least that’s how it feels. Many developers feel it. The inadequacy, the feelings of failure. That somehow, you’re not as talented as those around you.

The feeling that you’re an impostor.

Over and over we hear from talented developers who aren’t able to shake the feeling that they’re frauds. Talentless hacks who simply can’t measure up. Almost as if it’s a dirty secret they’re doing their best to cover up.

“Don’t let ‘them’ figure out you don’t deserve to be here.”


high school know everything


Have you ever received praise, or even an award, for being great at something despite having no clue what youíre doing? Do you feel like a fraud, wondering what sort of voodoo youíve unwittingly conjured up to make people think you know what youíre doing, when the reality is quite the contrary?

And the winner of the inaugural award was me. I was startled, confused, and amazed. If they had said my name half a second earlier, the person in front of me would have had a mouthful of Coke in their hair.

How could I win such an award, being in a room with so many great entrepreneurs and so many exciting companies and business ideas? There were companies in the competition already making a million dollars in yearly revenue (eligibility for the competition required that your company be making less that $3 million annually). By comparison, I wasnít even making enough to quit my day job yet. I had to fake a doctorís appointment that day just to attend the awards ceremony. Donít these other people know what theyíre doing more than I?

The 3 Types of Knowledge

To really understand how it is that no one knows what theyíre doing, we need to understand the three fundamental categories of information.

Thereís the shit you know, the shit you know you donít know, and the shit you donít know you donít know.
An example of shit you know would be knowing that itís okay to eat an apple should you come across an apple tree (however unlikely that may be).

An example of the shit you know you donít know would be wondering if you can eat these berries. As a result, you may decide to play it safe and keep moving, or you may decide to eat one now, see if you get sick, and if not, eat some more.

For an example of shit you donít know that you donít know, imagine if you were raised in an extremely sheltered environment, and you were never taught that some plants are poisonous. Finding yourself suddenly stranded in the wild, you would probably just start eating plants at random as you become hungry, without thinking twice. Pretty soon you would likely fall sick and die from dysentery or mycetism.

As illustrated by this example, you can see that the only dangerous category is the shit you donít know that you donít know (excluding extreme situations of life and death, where only the first category [shit you know] could save you). The same goes for any profession.

If Iím an engineer designing a bridge, I know that I need to account for that locationís climate when choosing the materials for building the bridgeÖ this is stuff I know. I may not know exactly which materials have stress limits within boundaries set by the climate, but I can look it upÖ this is stuff I know that I donít know. However, if I were a Veterinarian, and someone asked me to design a bridge, I may not even realize that different materials are affected differently by environmental factorsÖ this would be stuff I donít know that I donít know. And in this situation, someone would probably die.
The guilt can be crushing. Everyone seems to be getting stuff done, except you. You drag yourself out of bed, go to work, start checking email, start deleting, then poof, it's noon. Lunch, perhaps at your desk, then some awful meetings, then it's 3pm. You start REALLY working, then you start feeling decent but then it's 5pm or 6pm. It's time to start getting home. You feel like you didn't really get a lot done today so you'll work late - just tonight - to catch up.


So what then is the point of education and experience? Your professors and teachers (and typical exam structure) would lead you to believe that you must cram as much information as possible into the shit you know category.

I am going to be bold and suggest that this is wrong. The goal isnít to put as much as possible into the first category, itís to take as much as possible out of the third category.

Now whether this means putting it into the first or the second category isnít as important, as long as itís not in the third category. In other words, the goal is to be not dangerous.

The real reason you feel like a fraud is because you have been successful in taking a lot of information out of the third category and put it into the second category; you know of a lot of stuff you donít know. The good news is that this makes you very not dangerous. The bad news is that it also makes you feel dumb and helpless a lot of the time.

The not getting stuff done sucks, but the guilt and self-loathing is where you really get into trouble. You likely don't say it out loud, but you think it. You might not tell your spouse, but you think it. I suck. Man, I suck. I'm just not getting a damn thing done.

Fixed-mindset people feel smart when they donít make mistakes, growth-mindset people feel smart when they struggle with something for a long time and then finally figure it out. Fixies try to blame the world when things go bad, growthers look to see what they can change about themselves. Fixies are afraid to try hard because if they fail, it means theyíre a failure. Growthers are afraid of not trying.

It turns out there’s a psycho-babble name for this: Impostor Syndrome. As Inc Magazine points out, studies show that “40% of successful people consider themselves frauds.” Ask any small business coach; they’ll confirm how prevalent these feelings are. It’s even common with PhD candidates.

Although not an official psychological disorder, and generally not crippling, if you have these feelings it’s useful to know that it’s common and there’s something you can do about it.

See if these sound familiar:

You dismiss complements, awards, and positive reinforcement as “no big deal.”
You are crushed by mild, constructive criticism.
You believe you’re not as smart/talented/capable as other people think you are.
You worry others will discover you’re not as smart/talented/capable as they think you are.
You think other people with similar jobs are more “adult” than you are, and they “have their shit together” while you flounder around.
You feel your successes are due more to luck than ability; with your failures it’s the other way around.
You find it difficult to take credit for your accomplishments.
You feel that you’re the living embodiment of “fake it until you make it.

Can these feelings be constructive? Yes, if they’re a sign that you’re striving to learn and improve. As Andy Wibbels says:

If I don’t feel like a fraud at least once a day then I’m not reaching far enough.

If you aren’t scared shitless then why bother?


1.  Take the first step.
The greatest miracle of your success in life will not be that you finished, it will be that you had the courage to begin.

The feeling you get from taking the first step is far better than the feeling you get from sitting around thinking about it.  Get up and get moving.  Take the first step today ñ just one small step forward on that goal youíve been meaning to work on.

Even if you donít feel 100% prepared right now, your worst try will always be 100% more effective than the person who never did.  It is so easy to get caught up in planning and perfecting that before you know it, you have made taking the first step a bigger deal than it is.  Sometimes you just have to go ahead and take things as they come, one step at a time.

So give up the excuses and begin now.  Tomorrow you will be happy you started today.

In an interview with Rookie magazine, Watson said: “It’s almost like the better I do, the more my feeling of inadequacy actually increases, because I’m just going, ‘Any moment, someone’s going to find out I’m a total fraud, and that I don’t deserve any of what I’ve achieved’.”

This is an example of an interesting phenomenon called imposter syndrome – where people are seen as successful by outside external measures but internally they feel themselves to be frauds, undeserving of their success and in danger at any moment of being exposed.

Have you ever had the feeling that you’re in over your head? That you’ve had many successes but somehow you feel you don’t deserve them? There’s been some mistake. You were just lucky that time, the right questions came up in the exam or the interview. And despite all evidence to the contrary, that nagging feeling persists that, at any moment, someone will tap you on the shoulder and say: “You shouldn’t be here.”
