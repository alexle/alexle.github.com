Bad advice “Follow your passion, and the money will come” is bad advice for most people. Instead, it’s much better to pursue a field you like that’s in high demand so you can build your financial empire and get out before you become too old and bitter to change.




We’re often told to live everyday like it’s our last. I think that’s bad advice.

Most of us still have a long way to go, and a good way to make it miserable is through shortsightedness. That said, I do think we can build on the idea.

When I’m unsure about how to move forward, I like to ask myself a different question. It’s taught me more about myself than most books I’ve read.


If you knew that you were going to die exactly 5 years from today, what would that embolden you to change in your life?


5 years is a while, but it’s short enough to make you assess your priorities.

It’s forced me to rethink what it means to extract value out of time, it’s made me better attuned to evaluate risks, and it’s instilled in me an urgency to act.

Living every day like it’s your last is impractical. Living every day with the acknowledgment that life is finite is a tool to make better decisions.
