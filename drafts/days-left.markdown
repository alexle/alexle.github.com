For those of you who are obsessed about getting rich, think really hard about trying to kill yourself so that one day you can live the lifestyle that everyday, middle class people get to live right now. And for those of you who’ve already achieved a comfortable level of wealth, what are you really trying to prove? Making more money when you already have so much more than most people is so meaningless. Take a step back and think about creating more purpose instead.


 I can say with 100% certainly life is better earning less! Not poverty level less, just enough to have all your needs and some wants covered.

 I don’t miss the fancy meals or business class trips to Asia because at the end of the day, it was still work. I am totally content eating a $2.60 In N’ Out cheeseburger instead of a $80 wagyu steak as well. Further, I couldn’t give a baboon’s ass about prestige or power
 But even that lifestyle is not much better than that of a regular income earning person who is living a purposeful lifestyle. Appreciate what you have right now. Being rich is not an amazing panacea. Being free with the consistent ability to help other people is.

I'm not saying that to depress you. I mention it because, as great philosophers have reminded us, remembering the shortness of life is what spurs us all to live authentically. When you're cognizant of the fact that time is short, you value it appropriately.

And when you value time appropriately, you don't want to waste it. If you have any sense at all of how precious your life is, you already try to avoid obvious ways to fritter away your hours and years, like too many TV binges or sticking with a job you know in your heart you're not suited for. But there are many ways to let life pass you by that are less easy to spot and therefore more dangerous. I've rounded up a few here.


Whip out your calculator when you set your goals: Counting the number of days until your deadline may help you make progress sooner, suggests new research from University of Southern California.

Researchers asked people when they thought they should start saving money for life events like retirement. The study participants were told that the event was either years awayâ€”say, 18â€”or days awayâ€”6,570. The people who knew the number of days planned to start saving four times sooner than those who thought of their goals as years away.

Thatâ€™s because counting down the daysâ€”even if itâ€™s thousands of themâ€” makes the future feel close and in need of current attention, explains lead researcher Daphna Oyserman, Ph.D.

While the study focused on saving money, the strategy can be applied to any goal, Oyserman says. For example, if you want to lose weight for a vacation next year, itâ€™s easy to feel like you can put off your diet and exercise regimen, he says. But knowing that youâ€™ll be shirtless on the beach 349 days from now makes you want to hit the gym ASAP.

If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by surprise. And that is just what tends to happen. You take things for granted, and then they're gone. You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other people die. Their lives are short too. After my mother died, I wished I'd spent more time with her. I lived as if she'd always be there. And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion. But an illusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I did.

The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to be consciously aware of it. Back when life was more precarious, people used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem a bit morbid. I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right answer to be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at everyone's shoulder. Perhaps a better solution is to look at the problem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother. You don't need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait. Just don't wait.

I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has. Both make sense here.

How you live affects how long you live. Most people could do better. Me among them.

But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention to the time you have. It's easy to let the days rush by. The "flow" that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin that prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry of errands and alarms. One of the most striking things I've read was not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter's Burning the Days.

It is possible to slow time somewhat. I've gotten better at it. Kids help. When you have small children, there are a lot of moments so perfect that you can't help noticing.

It does help too to feel that you've squeezed everything out of some experience. The reason I'm sad about my mother is not just that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have done that we didn't. My oldest son will be 7 soon. And while I miss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don't have any regrets over what might have been. We had the best time a daddy and a 3 year old ever had.

Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life is short.

Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it's impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.
