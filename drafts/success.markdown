"One coin wonøt make you rich, but the only way to get rich is by collecting coins." [Gretchen: This is one of my favorite teaching stories! Here's an episode of A Little Happier where I talk about it.] My life today is the sum total of my past choices. Each small action may feel inconsequential, but every one counts. Every smart decision you make adds value to your future self. Books are read and written one word at a time, well-being is improved one healthy decision at a time, relationships are strengthened one kind deed at a time, retirement accounts grow one dollar at a time, and marathons are finished one step at a time. Every extra minute of reading, writing, brownie-skipping, gym-hitting, hugging, thanking, saving, and stepping adds up over time. Everything counts.








The Problem With Success Porn

Within a few seconds of logging onto the internet, we’re bombarded with images of people with zero fat, lean perfect bodies, happy and loving relationships, a job that they love every single moment working, a thriving business making millions of dollars in profits and a Lamborghini parked in front of a 20-acre home in The Hamptons overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.

But, is this reality?

The problem is that more so than ever, the results of success are highly visible, glamorized and deceptive.

Just scroll through the images on your social media feeds and it would appear as if everyone else apart from yourself is enjoying success in life.

But in reality, these images are only a highlight reel of people’s best moments. The remaining 99% of their lives are as boring and repetitive as yours.

To add insult to injury, ‘success gurus’ promote their lifestyles, and ‘must-buy’ self help books and products that will teach you the ‘hidden secrets’ of success.

Not only do these glamorized images of success create feelings of insecurity and dissatisfaction with our lives, they also overvalue the results and undervalue the difficulties of achieving success.

And so, when times are tough and you’re falling behind on your goals, it’s much easier to give up than to stay consistent and finish what you start, because of the unrealistic expectations created by these images.

But the irony of this all is that it’s the process behind the scenes—which we’re often blind to and the media hardly promotes—that creates the visible success that we glamorize.

The path to success isn’t glamorous or sexy. In fact, for the most part, it’s unsexy: boring, repetitive and drawn-out.

The difference between successful people and everyone else, is that they’ve learned to fall in love with the process of consistently doing the unsexy work that others aren’t willing to do.

For example:

If you want to be a successful author, learn to fall in love with the lonely process of writing for months and years, the paralysis of researching ideas for your book, and the tedious process of revising, editing and marketing your work after it’s published.

If you want to be a successful entrepreneur, learn to fall in love with the lonely process of working on your business for months and years without profits, the tedious process of hiring and firing, marketing and sales, and pivoting your business.

If you want to get into great shape, learn to fall in love with the tedious process of counting calories, cooking and eating boring meals, exercising 3 to 5 times a week, and going to bed early.

Over the short period of a week or month, the advantage is marginal. But, over a time span of five to 10 years, the gulf between the person who consistently does what others won’t do and the person who doesn’t, is ginormous!

Fall in Love With the Process

“Everyone wants to be successful until they see what it actually takes.”

— Unknown

We’ve all heard the saying that “Rome wasn’t built in a day,” wise words that capture the idea that time is all it takes to achieve great things.

But that’s not the whole story.

Just like how Rome was built through the tedious process of laying one brick at a time for many years, success is built by consistently doing the work that others aren’t willing to do.

The difference between successful people and everyone else, is that they’ve fallen in love with the process of pursuing their goals and the hardship that comes with it—the boredom, drudgery, loneliness, criticisms and failures.

And most importantly they’ve embraced The Iron Mike Rule which reminds them to:

“Do what you hate to do, but do it like you love it.”







3. That one sentence text message means so much.
øCongrats on the new jobø
øHope you sell your house for a good priceø
øThanks for being my mentorø
øLet me know if you need anythingø
øI believe you can do itø
øIøm cheering on the sidelines for youø

Youøve probably never thought these very brief messages would mean much. You probably took these short messages for granted. Next time youøre at rock bottom though, see how these short messages can completely change everything.

Thatøs why I send messages like this all the time because you never know when someone is at rock bottom or may need a few words to change their perspective.







“Success is almost totally dependent upon drive and persistence. The extra energy required to make another effort or try another approach is the secret of winning.” -Denis Waitley


When I was growing up there was a silent yet unanimously agreed upon definition of what success looked like in my family.  Although it was never openly discussed, it was implied through various conversations and decisions I was directly or indirectly included in.

All of my immediate and extended family members were in one of two groups:

College educated with a comfortable salaried job at a large corporation
Blue-collar worker who diligently worked his or her way up the corporate ladder at a large corporation
The commonality being a steady paycheck from a large corporation.





Discipline.

Put your phone down for a second and look around. If you're at work, if you're out to eat, if you're shopping, just watch what's going on around you. Look at what a distracted society we have become. And we aren't even being distracted by things worth being distracted by. We're being misdirected by cat videos and silly Instagram memes and things that give us a tiny hit of pleasure but no real fulfillment.

The single most valuable skill set you could possibly have today is discipline. It's not intelligence, because anything you want to know you can just look up on the Internet. And it's not something like having a powerful network, because what good is a network if you can't deliver?

Becoming successful, now more than ever, is about having the ability to shut off the noise and get to work.


Think about what an advantage you have over everyone else if you can avoid losing hours every single day to the distractions of 2017. Think about how many more moments you can stay in deep focus if you can get the habit of refreshing your email over and over again under control. Think about how much you could get done by no longer checking Instagram obsessively. Think about how many times in a day you postpone your goals just to consume another sugary piece of content, or watch the next episode on Netflix.

Discipline is truly the secret behind any successful young person.

Because without discipline, without the ability to focus on what you need to focus on (when you need to focus on it), your life becomes one with "the wave." The wave of life whips you around, and you have no control. You let people and things distract you. Your goals take a backseat to everyone else prying for your attention. But when you master the art of discipline, of shutting out the noise so that you can put yourself and your goals first, you become the surfer. You see the wave, and you can ride it, because you've put yourself in a position to do so.



All that I wanted to achieve before I turned 30.

Have a certain amount of salary. Travel to certain number of places. Buy a certain car. Save a certain amount. Get a certain home in my name. Marry a certain person.

Be at a certain place both personally and professionally. Basically, be settled.

Now, I'm turning 30. Soon. Very soon.

But I'm nowhere as settled as I thought I'd be. And that's fine. It isn't the end of the world.

We all are encouraged to have a plan for our lives.

Growing up, we have a mind full of dreams and heart full of desires. When school and college end and work takes over, we're supposed to have a set plan in place.

What's your five-year plan? Ten-year plan? Life becomes a race.

A race to beat your colleagues. Friends. Cousins. Every single person on this planet.

You have to start making money. Enough to get married. Enough to take a home loan. Enough to invest in your future.

It's the same pattern for everyone. Except that life is rarely the same for everyone.

It doesn't always turn out the way we wanted, right?

What happens, then? Are we supposed to sit and sulk as failures? Or, get up, face reality and accept that our lives won't be like others?

Just because you didn't end up getting a six-figure salary or a fancy SUV doesn't mean life is over. Because you're not earning as much as your cousin doesn't make you any less of a success.

Every one has a different path. Every one is meant for a different journey.




i feel success these days is gauge by how much money you earn and that's so unhealthy and doing what we've been told or what society tells us to do .. if those hours are miserable, what's the point


I used to think I needed more for success. More money, a bigger home, more stuff, and giant goals. Today, I know living with less is my new definition of success. I am happier and healthier because I own less stuff, live in a small space, and create goals around things that really mean something to me.
Success is the people around me, doing work I love, and taking care of my body, brain, heart, and soul.
1. Productivity Isn't About How Much You Produce, It's About How Much You Accomplish

When I first started my year of productivity, I created a Stats page so I could share exactly how productive I was every day. Every day I posted the number of words I wrote, pages I read, and hours I worked, because I considered these to be pretty good measurements of how productive I was.

I couldn't have been more wrong.

Unless you run a factory, measuring your productivity based only on how much you produce gives you only a shallow, limited picture of how productive you are. In fact, if you come up with an intelligent and creative approach to a problem—let's say that you find a way to write 500 words in 100—when you measure your productivity simply by how much you produce, you're much less productive!

It's easy to get caught up on measurements and statistics, but as far as personal productivity is concerned, statistics are secondary. Productivity isn't about how much you produce, it's about how much you accomplish.

It's important to do tasks that are high leverage and meaningful, and it's also important that you know how to manage your time, energy, and attention so you have the resources you need to get more done. But at the end of the day, when you have no more time, energy, or attention left, the only thing you're left with is what you have accomplished, and the difference you have made in the world because you did something valuable with a day of your life.


And isn’t it funny how day by day nothing changes, but when you look back everything is different?  That’s the power of daily rituals.

"It's not about getting rich and making a lot of money. It's about security," he said. It's also as much about hope for the next generation as it is about the success of this one. "They want to feel that their children are going to have a better life than they do," said Hirschl.
In their book, the authors write that besides economic security, the American dream includes "finding and pursuing a rewarding career, leading a healthy and personally fulfilling life, and being able to retire in comfort."

What Successful People Do Every Day

The truth is, what you do today matters. What you do every day matters. Donít fall into the trap of thinking one brownie wonít hurt your weight-loss goal or a day without social media engagement wonít affect your site traffic. Successful people do the small things that seem to make no difference in the act of doing them. And they make the choice to keep doing them over and over and over. Because one brownie today, one ice cream cone tomorrow, and one chocolate bar on Friday all add up to significant deviation from your nutritional plan at the end of the week.

If I could get you to make one change, it would be this vital shift in perspective: Your little choices add up to big results.

Do one simple discipline each day that brings you closer to your New Yearís goal, and make a habit of doing some sort of daily review of these activities, either through a journal, list, or work with a friend, colleague, or coach. Taking the time to do this extra accountability step can make all the difference between defeat and victory.

For each area of life where you may set New Yearís goals, there are tried and true daily disciplines you can do. Here are a few examples to get you started. If you want to... 

Save money: Take a few dollars out of a paycheck each week ó put it into savings and leave it there.
Get fit: Do a few minutes of exercise every day ó and donít skip it.
Stay motivated: Read 10 pages of an inspiring book every day.
Nurture relationships: Take a moment every day to tell someone how much you appreciate him or her.
Practice gratitude: Every day, write a list of three things for which youíre grateful.

If youíre willing to be patient and apply some simple daily disciplines to your everyday life, then success may be even closer than you think. You can turn around a losing streak and not only meet but exceed your New Yearís goals (and your goals at any other time of the year). Even if you donít accomplish everything on your to-do list in one day, the fact that you are following a plan on the road to success speaks volumes!

While most of my peers were buying bigger houses and fancier cars in their late-30s, I decided to go the other way by downsizing to a smaller house and buying a Honda Fit after my 14-year-old vehicle couldnít pass the California smog test. Iíve worn the same clothes for the past 10 years and have shoes from before 2005.
