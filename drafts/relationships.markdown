It’s no surprise that we are so bad at marriage in this culture.

We’re bad at it because we don’t understand it, and we don’t understand it because we don’t understand love. You can’t forge a lasting marriage if all you know about love is what you learned from an Ed Sheeran song. It’s like trying to build a car when you think engines run on fairy dust. And that’s essentially how many of us approach marriage. We believe it’s fueled by some intense and mystical emotional force — a force we inaccurately call “love” — and as soon as we run out of this mysterious cosmic gasoline all we can do is send it to the scrap yard and find a new model.

This view is popular in our society because it removes all responsibility and blame from the individual. Marriage is presented as a passive endeavor, established and destroyed by forces outside of our control. Love is something you “fall into,” like a puddle, and then “out of,” like an unsafe carnival ride, and there’s not much you can really do to cause the one or prevent the other. “These things happen,” we say. Oops, I’m married. Oops, I’m having an affair. Oops, I’m divorced. Oops, I’m married again. Oops, I’m divorced again. Oops, I’m lonely and isolated and everyone I’ve ever known resents me. Oops!

But here’s the reality: these were our choices, every step of the way, and that state which we’ve found ourselves falling in and out of is not real love. Real love is an act of will. A decision. A conscious activity. It is something you do and live. Love is chosen, and if it is protected and nurtured, it grows. Love is sacrifice. Love is effort. Love is everything St. Paul describes in First Corinthians, and especially in Ephesians 5: “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy.” Love is dying to the self. Love is many things, and none of them happen by accident.

Even people who understand this will still sometimes talk about love in a way that contributes to the confusion. A married couple may describe the moment they “fell in love,” very early on in their relationship, well before they walked down the aisle. They may even claim to have experienced “love at first sight.” This is all fine fodder for Hallmark cards and Nicholas Sparks novels — which, as we know, are based on Hallmark cards — but it doesn’t actually make sense. Far be it for me to make this determination, but, no, you didn’t love your wife the moment you laid eyes on her. You thought she was hot, sure, but that’s not the same thing.

I can say with certainty that I love my wife now. I can also say that I did not love her a week after I’d met her. I surely didn’t love her the first time I saw her. I thought she was beautiful. I liked a lot of things about her. But love her? No. How could I? I didn’t know her. I’d made no commitment to her. I wasn’t sharing my life with her. I wasn’t really sharing anything with her except for an appetizer at Chili’s. Yes, I loved her as a child of God, in the same sense that I’m obligated to love all humanity, but I didn’t love her in the way that I love her now. I couldn’t have. This love, the love we have now, is defined by commitment, sacrifice, and devotion, and none of those dimensions are present when you’re just dating someone.

It’s more accurate to say, when we first met, I was infatuated with her. There was an intense, mostly selfish, attachment. I wasn’t being intentionally selfish, it just made me feel good to be around her so I tried to be around her as much as possible. That’s what I liked most about her at this stage: how she made me feel. I didn’t “love” her for her own sake, but for my sake. I think every relationship must start this way, but it can’t survive if it stays this way.

Absurdly, people often refer to this period of infatuation as the “in love phase,” but there couldn’t be a worse way to describe it. This phase, this extraordinary emotional pull that you feel early in a relationship, is supposed to be the fuel that drives you to the altar. It isn’t love itself, but it gives you the incentive and energy to get there. It’s like the thrust that jettisons a rocket into outer space. If I knew anything about astrophysics I could extend the analogy, but hopefully you get my point. The infatuation you feel for your girlfriend has no real meaning or value on its own; it is, rather, a propulsion towards something.

The trouble is, in our culture, couples experience that propulsion but they don’t go anywhere with it. They have all of this emotional energy, all of this fuel, but they’re afraid to make the journey into the great beyond. Or they wait until it’s worn off and then, by default, after years of living together, finally tie the knot. There’s a reason why those relationships are much more likely to end in divorce. The so-called “in love phase” — which really has nothing to do with love — died away long ago, but it didn’t develop into true love because true love requires commitment, and they waited far too long to make the commitment. So they’ve lived with each other without the emotional attachment, and without love, for years before finally wandering lazily down the aisle. Not a good way to start things.

More commonly, of course, people will stay together only so long as the infatuation lasts. That’s how you end up with a generation of 20 and 30-somethings who’ve never been married but think they’ve had deep, rich “love” for, like, 19 different people. In truth, they never loved anyone. They simply experienced a fleeting enthusiasm over and over again. They’ve fallen into infatuation many times. They never once chosen love.

That’s the thing about marital love: it’s willful and decisive, but it also requires boldness and courage, because you won’t have it in its realest sense until after you’ve already gotten married. You say at the altar not that you have loved or did love your betrothed, but that you will. You’re choosing love, right then and there, despite not knowing them very well. After all, even if you date for a couple of years before marriage, which I don’t necessarily recommend, you still won’t know your future spouse with even a fraction of the depth and intimacy that you’ll know them after 5 or 10 or 15 or 20 years of marriage.  You know them only as a separate person, not as a person united with yourself until death. Yet you choose love anyway, and you are bound by that choice forever. This is the great power and mystery of the sacrament.

This is why I wouldn’t say that I ever “fell in love” with my wife. What makes our love real and fruitful is precisely that we didn’t fall into it. We promised it, made it, built it, established it, fought for it — there are many verbs you could use, but not “fall.” A man falls because he’s clumsy and gravity sneaks up on him. That’s not at all how marital love is formed or sustained, thank God. Our love is not an careless coincidence or a product of circumstance. It is so much greater than that.

It’s especially crucial for married couples to keep this in mind because, although my wife and I have not experienced this, many couples who’ve been together far longer than us will tell of emotional dry seasons that lasted for long stretches. During this period, they felt little attraction or affection, yet they still loved. They gained no emotional benefit from being around each other, but they still had their love. They loved because they understood that love is an act of devotion, and they were not relieved from the duty of that devotion just because they no longer felt all warm and fuzzy inside.

To a lot of people nowadays it seems almost scandalous to imagine that a couple would stay together even when their feelings turn cold for a time. We can’t understand that level of fidelity and sacrifice because, to us, the whole point of any romantic relationship is to find personal satisfaction. We “love” each other only as long as we get something immediate and pleasurable out of it. Once that goes, we go. Our love is no deeper and no more real after marriage than it was 5 seconds after we met. We “love” our spouses the same way we “loved” the person we took to our 9th grade homecoming dance.

Inevitably, if we approach marriage like hormonal teenagers, we will see the emotional dry season as an indication that we’ve “fallen out of love.” We won’t fight for our marriage or remain committed to our spouses because we think the whole point of our union was the emotional high it gave us. Now it’s gone, we don’t know why, and we can’t do anything about it. We’re utterly helpless. Love was like a magical elf that stayed with us for a while then scurried suddenly away, and all we can do is say farewell as it disappears into the woods. “Wave goodbye to our love, honey, it’s leaving now. Welp, time to get divorced.”‘

Naturally, this mentality also leads quickly to affairs. If love just “happens,” then who is to say it won’t “happen” with your coworker or someone you met at the gym? And if this thing that happens is actually love, and not, as I say, mere infatuation, then shouldn’t you go and be with that person? You love them! It was was meant to be! The fact that it came to be after you’d already married someone else is an unfortunate detail that can be dealt with later. If pursuing this “love” means dissolving your current family, well, then it’s the right thing to do — the “loving” thing, even. The kids will understand!

Speaking of kids, here’s a question for anyone who thinks they have fallen, or might fall, “out of love” with their spouse: what about your children? Can you fall out of love with them? And what if you do? Would you ever say to your daughter, “Sorry, I’m not feeling it anymore. The love is gone. I’m calling the adoption agency”?

No, most of us would agree that such a thing would be horrific. Even if you don’t feel particularly affectionate towards your kids in any particular moment — every parent has been there — you still love them, and you recognize that you have a duty to them. All decent human beings understand that you can’t abandon your children just because you have some unpleasant feelings about parenting. So, why don’t we understand this about marriage? Why do we love our kids no matter what, while attaching a series of conditions to the love we have for the very person we publicly pledged to love unconditionally?

For my part, I know that I owe my love to my kids and my wife, but nobody is more entitled to it — to me, all of me — than my wife. I am in debt to her. I promised her my love and I am called to fulfill that promise. True, it’s easy now. She’s a beautiful person, through and through, so holding up my end of the bargain is not a chore. But if those were conditions for my love — if I only intended to love her as long as she can stun me with her grace and beauty — then I would not love her at all. I would be a mercenary, in it just to get mine for as long as it remains profitable. That’s a fine approach to business, but it’s just not how marriage is supposed to work.


As I grow older, I become more and more aware that to get the most out of life, you need to be present. You need to pay attention to the small things, the details of life, because they add up to something greater than their parts. They are the ingredients of a live well-lived.

This awareness means you cannot sleepwalk through life, you need to engage with life.And there’s no place where this engagement is more vital, than with the regular, daily interactions you have with your husband or wife.



It’s a Constant Work in Progress
You might think once you’ve finally settled down you can relax and live happily ever after, but nothing can be farther from the truth. The years jumble together, and if you’re not careful you’ll easily take the marriage for granted. I didn’t know it over the years, but I think the thing that’s made the most difference for my marriage is our regular vacations and other traditions—things that force us to take stock again in our relationship and reconnect on a deep level. Just “being in love” isn’t enough to make a marriage work.

Even after decades of living together, you’ll be learning things about your partner, bit by bit, that might surprise you—or they’ll suddenly change or have different priorities and needs (“Really, you want to become a scuba diver now?” and “How come you never told me you don’t like olives?”). It’s like a dance, and you both have to keep up with each other. But what a beautiful dance it can be.


Mistake No. 1: expecting your partner to be your source of joy and aliveness.
Our mainstream culture of romantic love is predicated on the belief that your partner is supposed to "make" you feel alive and happy. If you had an infatuation stage (and not everyone does, which doesn't make a relationship any less worthy), you would have experienced a "free ride" during which you indeed felt like your partner was the answer to your problems. Riding on the intoxicating cocktail of hormones and the openhearted excitement that often defines the first, young stage of love, you felt like you were floating a cloud. It seemed like nothing could burst your high... until something did.

One day you woke up and realized that the colors of life, so brilliant in Technicolor when you felt "in love," now look a bit drab. And the first thought to pop into your mind was, "I guess I'm not in love. Maybe I'm in the wrong relationship."

The mistake isn't that you "fell out of love." That's what happens in love. The mistake is interpreting the lack of aliveness as a message that it's time to leave. When infatuation dies, it's not time to leave. It's time to learn about the real work of love, which is about understanding that love is a commitment, a choice, and an act of will. Real love asks what you can give more than what you get.

It's not your partner's job to be the source of your joy; that's your job and yours alone. It's your partner's job to be supportive, loving, honest, kind, and of strong moral character, and if your partner has those qualities, you are blessed. There's no reason to walk away just because the feelings you typically associate with loving have faded away.







	We must fiercely resist the idea that true love must mean conflict-free love, that the course of true love is smooth. It’s not. The course of true love is rocky and bumpy at the best of times. That’s the best we can manage as the creatures we are. It’s no fault of mine or no fault of yours; it’s to do with being human. And the more generous we can be towards that flawed humanity, the better chance we’ll have of doing the true hard work of love.


 We have this ideal of what love is and then these very, very unhelpful narratives of love. And they’re everywhere. They’re in movies and songs. And we mustn’t blame songs and movies too much. But if you say to people, “Look, love is a painful, poignant, touching attempt by two flawed individuals to try and meet each other’s needs in situations of gross uncertainty and ignorance about who they are and who the other person is, but we’re going to do our best,” that’s a much more generous starting point.



Dating is an important part of romantic relationships, and this shouldn't stop when a couple gets married. Spending time together, learning more about one another, and connecting emotionally are all helpful in growing closer as a couple.





A lot of people ask me what my biggest fear is, or what scares me most. And I know they expect an answer like heights, or closed spaces, or people dressed like animals, but how do I tell them that when I was 17 I took a class called Relationships For Life and I learned that most people fall out of love for the same reasons they fell in it. That their lover’s once endearing stubbornness has now become refusal to compromise and their one track mind is now immaturity and their bad habits that you once adored is now money down the drain. Their spontaneity becomes reckless and irresponsible and their feet up on your dash is no longer sexy, just another distraction in your busy life. 
Nothing saddens and scares me like the thought that I can become ugly to someone who once thought all the stars were in my eyes.

After my teacher introduced us to this theory, she asked us, “is love a feeling? Or is it a choice?” We were all a bunch of teenagers. Naturally we said it was a feeling. She said that if we clung to that belief, we’d never have a lasting relationship of any sort.

She made us interview a dozen adults who were or had been married and we asked them about their marriages and why it lasted or why it failed. At the end, I asked every single person if love was an emotion or a choice.

Everybody said that it was a choice. It was a conscious commitment. It was something you choose to make work every day with a person who has chosen the same thing. They all said that at one point in their marriage, the “feeling of love” had vanished or faded and they weren’t happy. They said feelings are always changing and you cannot build something that will last on such a shaky foundation.

The married ones said that when things were bad, they chose to open the communication, chose to identify what broke and how to fix it, and chose to recreate something worth falling in love with.

The divorced ones said they chose to walk away.

Ever since that class, since that project, I never looked at relationships the same way. I understood why arranged marriages were successful. I discovered the difference in feelings and commitments. I’ve never gone for the person who makes my heart flutter or my head spin. I’ve chosen the people who were committed to choosing me, dedicated to finding something to adore even on the ugliest days.

I no longer fear the day someone who swore I was their universe can no longer see the stars in my eyes as long as they still choose to look until they find them again. at




Have you ever run out of gas and been stranded on the side of the road? If so, you quickly realize why. You either chose not to fill up the tank in hopes you could make it, or you didn't realize you were almost empty. Regardless, it's not a fun experience.

We all have an emotional love tank, and it gets filled when people speak our love language. Fueling up often is vital to avoiding a relationship "breakdown." Have you ever asked your loved ones if their tank is full? If not, try doing it. If it's almost empty, begin finding ways to creatively and consistently speak their love language. If it's almost full, it never hurts to top off. Below you will find ideas to get you started.





How do you know when you love someone?
I used to believe that love was a light switch. Something flicks on. You get an overwhelming sensation. It hits you like a bag of bricks. Or a strong arrow. When you know, you know. Right? Not so much. After 38 years and an expired marriage, I don’t see love that way anymore. I’ve placed Cupid right next to Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.
Love is a series of choices. The first choice is based on many many factors, including chemistry, principles, logic, humor, intelligence, body type, where we are in our lives, what we want/need… the list goes on and on, and the weight of each factor varies depending on the individual. Based on these factors, we either choose to begin the process to love or not. If we decide to enter this process, the action of loving can bring “light switch” moments. The way he looks at you. How hard she makes you laugh. The notes he hides in your purse. The way she makes you feel when you don’t feel anything.
But like an airplane flight, there is turbulence. The fights. The disagreements. The little things that bother you. His socks. Her shopping. You start wondering if you’ve made the right choice. Once you are in doubt, you have to make another choice: to continue to fly with this person or jump out of the plane. This choice is based on a thousand other factors, again depending on the individual and where they are in their journey. If you decide to jump, the scary free fall will either make you stronger (grow) or miserable (depressed), depending on whether you see your expiration as a rebirth or a death. But sooner or later, you’ll find yourself back at the airport waiting to board another plane. Then you hit turbulence. Or maybe there is no turbulence. Maybe you’ve changed your mind about the destination. Either way, another choice. Fly or jump?
Love is making a choice every single day, to either love or not love. That’s it. It’s that simple. Either to continue the process or not.



Think about your bank account and what happens if you don’t make regular deposits. The balance goes down, you lose cushion, and you could even end up in a worse position: a negative balance.

The same is true for love. In the economy of relationships, you can use the five love languages to keep your “account” full. As you do, you’ll have a sense of security, cushion for dealing with conflict, and confidence to bring your relationships to the next level.


Nobody likes to think about ending a relationship, but sometimes you have to face the hard truth: things just aren't going to work out. Here are four of the biggest things to look for in a toxic relationship.

Figuring out whether you should end a serious relationship will almost always leave you second guessing yourself. You'll think "oh, maybe this isn't that big a deal", or you'll hold out hope that your partner will change. However, if your relationship falls into one of the following categories, you should probably take quitting more seriously. 
Trust is one of the most important building blocks of any relationship, and if you or your partner did something to break it, it can be hard to let go. Perhaps they cheated, invaded your privacy, or shared your secrets with their friends. It's easy to say "forgive and forget", but it isn't so simple. If, at the end of the day, they can't regain your trust, the relationship might not be salvageable.

If you want to try and fix it, it's important for both parties to focus on a resolution instead of the details. Part of that is letting go of the past. Then, work to reach a clear compromise, and move forward holding true to that compromise.

If you're the one who's done the betraying, understand your role in the resolution. Psychology Today has another bit of advice here:

A betrayal is a broken agreement, implicit or explicit, that is considered vital to the integrity of a relationship. The capacity of a relationship to recover from a betrayal has a lot to do with the responses, particularly on the part of the betrayer to the situation. The more open and non-defensive they are, the more likely it is that there will be resolution. When both partners are committed to this as an outcome, the likelihood increases exponentially.

If you're the one who can't let go: it's tough to know when to trust your gut or your mind with these situations, but this one calls for logic. Try to be objective and observe the changes your partner is making. Let the past go for the moment, and give them the benefit of the doubt while the two of you work through the situation. Encourage them to keep going in a direction that benefits the relationship, rather than bring up past actions and use them as fuel in questioning their current ones.





Always make the first move.

The meaning is simple: if you can help the relationship, then do it. Don’t wait for the other person to act (even if you don’t want to).

Most people have strained and superficial relationships with family and even with friends. This is because most people always wait for the other person to “make the first move;” say hello, organize a hangout, or apologize.

This is a pride thing. It’s one of the main killers of marriages, friendships, and even families.

If you want to have deep, meaningful relationships with your friends, family, and even just the people in your day-to-day life, make the first move — even if it should be them. Be the first to:

Initiate the conversation
Send the first text
Say you miss them
Say you love them
Apologize and ask for forgiveness
Organize a hangout
Compliment them
Thank them
Tell them you appreciate what they did





5. Get Married. Be in a Long Term Relationship.
People say they want to end up with someone, they say they want to get married someday, and then what do they do? Everything but what makes that possible. Pick a person and be in a relationship already. It’s the best thing you will ever do. It’s a lot of work. It will be painful and tough at times. But it is better than the affluenza of Tinder. I’m not saying settle, but I am saying that relationships are great because you make them great, not because you search until you magically find one that’s already perfect. And enough with this polyamory nonsense. Maybe it makes .01% of the population happier, but the fact that they need to sell everyone on it so much makes me think it’s probably not working for them either. Neil Strauss wrote a wonderful book about this, don’t waste a decade of your life being an idiot.




Think about it. Would you like it if your girlfriend hassled you about you hanging out with your female friends? Probably not, right? You would feel caged. Trapped. Resentful about the fact that you’re having to cater to your girlfriend’s childish neuroticism. After all, we’re not in medieval times. People have friends of all genders.

My recommendation, therefore, is that you don’t make a hard and fast rule about whether your girlfriend can or can’t hang out with any male friends. You have to go on a case by case basis. Your suspicions might be warranted. But, as a general rule, you should investigate suspicions, not trust them immediately. Sometimes smoke means fire, but sometimes smoke just means someone’s smoking a big fat doobie. Your instincts are worth listening to, but not worth immediately obeying. Really examine whether there are any signs that she has a major lady-boner for this guy, then, if you think she does, raise the subject.





Upgrade Your Relationships 10x By Just SAYING It
“The bitterest tears shed over graves are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone.” -Harriet Beecher Stowe
(I wrote this section recently that ended up being highlighted by hundreds of people):

When my wife and I were in premarital counseling, our counselor gave us a piece of advice that would end up changing our lives:

Always make the first move.

The meaning is simple: if you can help the relationship, then do it. Don’t wait for the other person to act (even if you don’t want to).

Most people have strained and superficial relationships with family and even with friends. This is because most people always wait for the other person to “make the first move;” say hello, organize a hangout, or apologize.

This is a pride thing. It’s one of the main killers of marriages, friendships, and even families.

If you want to have deep, meaningful relationships with your friends, family, and even just the people in your day-to-day life, make the first move — even if it should be them. Be the first to:

I’m always baffled by how I seem to know so many amazing eligible people, but everyone’s complaining that there are no good people to date. Yet, from personal experience, I know finding someone to date can feel like a never-ending wait that’s bound to end in failure. But waiting is all you can do, right?

Well, before you order another piña colada and get comfortable, Hoffman attributes many of the struggles to finding a partner to approaching the situation passively rather than going after what you want. “One of my taglines on my website is Date Like It’s Your Job. You can date by chance and hope you connect with your dream partner, or you can date strategically and find someone who is an ideal match for you. I would rather do a little work to get a better result,” says Hoffman.

This totally makes sense and explains why there are so many single yet otherwise accomplished women out there — we’ve all been trained to believe that the man of our dreams will scoop us up when we least expect it, so in the meantime, we just need to patiently wait while dodging slimy swamp frog lips.

Hoffman recommends that anyone struggling to find love should try approaching things from the same way they would their career: “I teach women how to use the skills that have made them professionally successful (analytics, strategy, networking, training, mentorship, determination) to be just as successful in love.”


Remember That Making Yourself Happy Is Your Job
A strong partner or a marriage can be a huge, amazing shift in your life—but they can’t change everything. Ultimately, you need to take responsibility for your own happiness. Someone else can add to it, of course, but they can’t be the sole source of it. “I think that it’s always a good idea not to expect our partners to fulfill all our needs, period,” relationship therapist Aimee Hartstein, LCSW says. “The more we focus on filling our own needs, and maybe helping our friends and family out a little bit, the better off we will be. It’s not a great precedent to be too focused on what our partner can do for us. They are bound to feel pressured and we are bound to be disappointed.” Instead, make sure you’re nurturing yourself and also the other relationships in your life. That means you’ll have fulfillment coming from a lot of different places.




Thinking of motivation like this gives us a greater sense of freedom and greater insight into why we do what we do. You don’t pick up your bath towel off the floor to avoid getting admonished by your spouse (remember, punishment avoidance is extrinsic motivation). Rather, you do it because keeping the peace is important to you (intrinsic motivation). You don’t show up to work on time to avoid being fired or because your boss told you to; rather, you do it because remaining gainfully employed and maintaining positive relations with your boss are values you hold dear.

When you break it down, all motivation is intrinsic. A child cleans his room because he values keeping his parents happy, even if he doesn’t necessarily value not living in a pigsty. A salesperson closes the sale to provide for her family, even if she doesn’t necessarily value the company’s sales goals. When we try to convince or persuade someone, what we should really be doing is awakening that person’s internal incentive systems. In business, we often use money because we assume that people are intrinsically driven by what money affords. Same with praise, promotions, compliments, and the like. The trick, if it can be called that, is to match the external motivating factor with something that will become a driving force internally.

Next time you’re trying to convince someone to do something, don’t force him or her to connect the dots. Rather than offering a punishment or reward, go closer to the real intrinsic source. Appealing to someone’s internal motivations will always work more effectively than offering a random incentive. Don’t call your spouse fat; tell him you want to grow old together. Don’t tell an employee that she needs to work harder; tell her the time she spends at work is valued and will yield even greater success. Don’t offer your son money to clean his room; offer to take him to the store and buy him a record. Don’t criticize this article to my editor; tell her how much you value my opinion...on other subjects. In all cases, the desired outcome will be more likely and less painful.


Dream together and have fun picturing the future. Make the conversation one of possibilities instead of thinking it’s a chore,” says Longo. “What we want to talk about is the purpose of the dollars, the goals—what are we saving for?” She suggests sitting down together and envisioning your various goals: What do you want for your kids and their education? For your retirement together? If money were no object, what would you do? Make it fun. Assigning concrete goals can make it more real for your wife than abstract numbers with no “real” purpose, besides building your nest egg. If you have or want to have kids, you could also talk with your wife about the values you want to instill in them, and how you want to involve them in your money conversations. That can add purpose to getting your financial life together.


How to keep your marriage strong for the long run
Now I apply the principles I used in the weight room to my marriage. For example, I used to get anxious when my wife was feeling sad or stressed. And I used to snap at her if I felt attacked or threatened. For over a year I’ve been working to improve myself in this area. I practice self-soothing, taking deep breaths, and thinking before I speak, and giving my wife the benefit of the doubt and trying to understand her perspective when I feel hurt.

I’m definitely not perfect (a little secret: nobody is!), but I’m getting better at managing conflict between us and using it as an opportunity for understanding and growth. I’m less stressed out when she is. I snap at her less. My wife even smiles compassionately at me when she sees me taking deep breaths, or using the plans we’ve put in place to help us fight better and love smarter.

She’s commented that I’m improving, and because of that, we’re improving as a couple. But, like working out, it’s not easy, and especially not at first. It stretches your comfort zone. It pushes you to your limits. It expands your capacities as a human being. And this painful stretching and expanding and growing means that, sometimes, your partner and your marriage will not make you happy.

Honestly, marriage is a challenge. And it’s a good one because marriage reveals your limitations and exposes your weaknesses, flaws, and vulnerabilities. Marriage makes you painfully aware of how impatient you might be, of your struggles to say “no” to things that aren’t important and “yes” to things that are, and of how challenging it is to navigate your differences when you’re feeling overwhelmed or stressed, or simply hangry.

Marriage challenges you to deal with sickness, tragedy, financial stresses, changes in faith or beliefs, job loss, weight gain, raising kids, losing parents and other family members, and you have to do it all while supporting and satisfying another emotional human being!

You can’t tackle this stuff and come out on the other side still in love with each other by remaining the exact same people you were when you started. You can’t go through all of that together while remaining in perpetual bliss. You have to constantly grow and evolve into the version of you that’s capable of facing and overcoming the unique challenges that life throws at you at any given moment.




	This article is for those of you who are considering when is the right time to have a kid, how will having kids disrupt your career, how much you need to work, save, and invest to ensure your family is taken care of, and for those who want to be the best parent possible. I wish someone clearly explained to me the 2-5 year timeframe during my most gungho career days. I would have been much more serious about trying to start a family when I was 32, instead of trying at age 36-37. Being a full-time parent rivals the toughest jobs in the world. You need a tremendous amount of patience, endurance, and calmness about you because there is no reasoning with a baby/toddler. At any moment, she could injure herself or die. I would say in comparison, most jobs are a walk in the park compared to taking care of a baby/toddler. No wonder why so many parents can’t wait to get back to work after their parental leave is over! Now that I’ve spent over six months being a stay at home dad, I can unequivocally tell you that it was the best time spent. I wouldn’t trade any amount of money to not have that time with him. They grow up so fast. Once that time is over, you can never get it back.





Now that I’m a father, I think how crazy it would be not to have had my son. I wish I hadn’t focused so hard on my career so I could have had him sooner – ideally three years earlier. Given your kid will be one of the people you love most in your life, you will naturally wish you had him or her for a greater percentage of your life.

My net worth goal was one reason why I delayed getting married until I was 31, even though I knew my wife since I was 22. Before 31, I didn’t feel financially stable enough to support a family which had a child and a non-working spouse. There’s no way I wanted to go into a marriage without a strong feeling of financial security.




Here are six ways to be the most amazing girlfriend ever

1. Be Direct (Not Passive Aggressive)
The majority of problems in a relationship occur because the woman expects a man to meet her needs, and then resents him when he doesn’t. She doesn’t ask for what she wants because he should just “know.” She may drop hints to help him out and then become even more annoyed when he doesn’t pick up on them. The man, in turn, gets frustrated that nothing he does seems to be good enough. Eventually he gets discouraged and stops trying and she feels even more resentful.

Neither side has bad intentions, the problem is they aren’t communicating properly and the reason is because men and women have very different styles of communication. Men do not pick up on nuances and subtleties in the same way women do, they need things spelled out in a clear and direct manner.

If you’re mad at him, don’t act passive aggressive until he asks what’s wrong (to which you may reply “nothing,” and he’ll take that to mean nothing is wrong and you will continue to simmer because he should freakin’ know it’s something!), just tell him what it is he did wrong. In relationships it’s not usually what you say, it’s how you say it.

If you tell a guy something he is doing that is upsetting or hurting you in a loving, compassionate way, I guarantee he will try to fix it.
If you come from a place of anger or resentment, he’ll shut down and will be less motivated to correct it. Freud is regarded as one of the most brilliant minds in psychology and even he had no idea what women want, so how do you expect the average guy to do it?

Most arguments in relationships stem from deeper underlying issues that never get discussed or resolved. Maybe a woman feels like her guy doesn’t really care about her, or isn’t committed to her because he isn’t as attentive as he was in the beginning of the relationship, and instead of being direct about it, she freaks out on him if he doesn’t call her back one night or doesn’t do the dishes after she slaved away cooking dinner for him. From there a big fight may ensue over something trivial while the real issue goes untouched. When you want something, or don’t want something, just tell him.

3. Give Him Space When He Needs It
Another major difference between men and woman is in the way they handle stress and difficulties. While women typically seek out their friends and want to to talk about it, men would rather retreat into the proverbial man cave and deal with it on their own. A woman might get upset when this happens and think he’s shutting her out, but it really has nothing to do with her, it’s just how he deals with things.

If your boyfriend seems stressed and begins to withdraw, just let him be. Don’t coddle him or offer unsolicited advice or get on his case about why he isn’t confiding in you. If he wants to talk about it with you, he will. If he doesn’t and you continue to push him, you will just be another source of stress in his life that he needs to deal with and he’ll withdraw even further.
Men intuitively know that it isn’t easy for a woman to give him space when he needs it, and if you can do it without feeling angry or resentful towards him, you’ll be the woman who touches him more deeply than any other.

They get into a relationship and the guy becomes the sole center of their universe. This is never healthy!
For one thing, it kind of puts your relationship in a holding pattern and creates a scenario where you can be dating for years and years without taking the next step. If a guy is getting all of you, all the time, there’s no reason for him to take that extra step, but this is a whole other discussion.

Another issue is your relationship can’t be your only source of happiness and fulfillment, you need to have a balanced life with several components filling you up in different areas. If you throw all of that away for your guy, then you add a lot of pressure to the relationship and will never feel completely satisfied with what you’re getting from the relationship (mostly because no one can be your everything). You may start to resent your partner and feel that he owes you more since you gave up so much for him, but that’s not fair because the sacrifices you made were your choice. Another reason not maintaining your own life outside of the relationship is problematic is you may end up staying in a bad relationship for far longer than you should have because, well, you have nothing else to go back to anything.

Men typically fall in love with a woman in her absence, not her presence. If you’re always there he won’t experience that deepening of the bond. To keep your relationship fresh and invigorating, it’s essential to have time apart to do your own things. It gives you a break from the emotional intoxication of relationships so you can see things more objectively and it takes some pressure off the relationship so it can unfold more organically.

I know it’s tempting to hang out with him every time he asks, I know it’s flattering when a guy wants so much of your time, I know you may think it’s because he is just so crazy about you… and maybe he is, but giving in every single time is just not a good strategy. If he’s a decent guy, he’ll respect your boundaries and will encourage you to do your own thing on occasion.

Look, you don’t need to be red carpet ready at all times, but you really should make an effort to try to maintain your appearance and look good for your guy. You put your best face forward during those first few months of dating and there’s no reason for it to stop once things are more established.

It will keep the passion and lust alive in your relationship and also, it feels really good to a man when a woman puts in effort to look good for him.
The funny thing I notice is women in relationships (again, myself included), will lounge around the house in sweats and a messy bun and no makeup when they’re home with their guy, but will put on a face-full of makeup and get decked out when going out, to impress strangers? The whole thing is so backwards. A guy friend once lamented to me that his girlfriend had put on about 15 pounds since they started dating and canceled her gym membership.

He told me he was still very much attracted to her, but he just couldn’t understand why she wasn’t taking care of herself anymore and that was more of a turn-off than the weight gain. He felt like she just didn’t care anymore and he felt stuck because there was no way to say something without her being offended and hurt. He pleaded with me to spread the gospel and tell women that while his love isn’t only contingent on your physical appearance, it’s really important (and attractive) to continue taking care of yourself at the same level as when you first met… and so I have!





3They Show Appreciation For Each Other
Ashley Batz/Bustle
Couples who manage to stay deeply in love know that the grass isn't always greener. "While it may be tempting to explore a new, exciting, attractive, and interesting person, couples who stay in love know that people come with their own set of flaws," divorce lawyer Joryn Jenkins, tells Bustle. They're happy with the ones they have and actively work together to remember why they chose each other in the first place. They're appreciative of their partner and show it. "If you're married, remember that you vowed to be together 'for better, for worse,'" Jenkins says. "Sometimes, it’s a 'for worse' period. But, this too shall pass. The good times will return if you weather the storm together and don’t jump ship."




If you have a favorite sports team, it’s natural to want them to win. The opposition is considered the enemy, and when your team plays hard and secures a victory, it’s likely you celebrate. Winners and losers can be fun when it comes to sports, but not so much when it comes to relationships.

When we “win” relational conflicts, it isn’t much cause for celebration. Why? Because in the process, we’ve inadvertently created a loser. And if one person is a loser, we both lose—intimacy, togetherness, empathy, and more.

Healthy relationships focus on finding a solution, not on declaring a winner. Resolving conflict calls for respecting each other’s ideas and then seeking a solution that will affirm the honor, respect, and—depending on the relationship—love for the other person. The best solutions are ones where both parties involved feel positive about the outcome. In other words, a healthy relationship is a winning relationship.


When it comes to irritations and issues in your relationships, do you tend to turn a blind eye hoping they will just go away? If so, your relationships will never be authentic.

In healthy relationships, people must talk about the things that irritate them. They must seek to negotiate solutions that will respect their differences. Put your head in the sand, and your problems will get worse. Speak the truth in love, and you can solve your problems.

For example, don't change the subject when your spouse brings up a topic that you think will start an argument. Simply ask, "Do you want us to share our ideas and look for a solution? If so, I'm willing to talk. If we are simply going to argue, I don't have the energy to do that. If we can respect each other's thoughts, I think we can find an answer."

This is the way to build healthy relationships.




what are you looking for in a RL? what's something i should know about you? what do you think about ___? are you happy with that?




1.  Stop expecting the worst from people. It sounds kind of cliché, but the best starting point is trust 2. Accept people as they really are. "Learn to recognize their limitations and your own, and be forgiving when expectations aren't met. Sometimes the person is actually doing the best they can within their limits. When it's not really hurting either me or the other person, it means we just need a bit of maturity and flexibility. 3. And understand that actually flawless people don't exist. I've learned that perfect people don't exist, but there are people with imperfections that you can live with. For example, I could never stand relationships with dumb people and never have. My husband isn't dumb; however, he is very disorganized. That, I can live with, without fighting 6. Learn to communicate nonviolently. "Try to have heartfelt and vulnerable conversations with people, even if it means having a mini panic attack out of fear of reaction. It helped me a lot to use the principles of Nonviolent Communication, which are to:

1) Observe what I'm feeling

2) Identify what the emotion is about — without judgment or expectations placed on the other person

3) Identify what need of mine wasn't met and why I was upset/hurt/sad/happy

4) Make a clear request regarding all this to the other person.

This involves a lot of emotional vulnerability and confronting your own mistakes, too. But this way, it's easier to know what's bothering you and transform it into a clear request. You get a clearer perspective about what your relationship can be: an agreement between parties. I've become a fan and I pass it on to everyone. 7. Stop outsourcing your feelings. Understand which part of the problem is on you. This isn't to absolve the other person of responsibility, but to recognize that the way we react to any situation varies greatly according to our experiences and personal baggage. 8. Respect other people's emotional frequency. Going all day without talking or responding to texts doesn't always mean that something is up. Sometimes, it just means that the other person just has a different emotional frequency than you. Everything is fine; it doesn't necessarily mean that one person 'loves' the other more. 9. And if your different frequencies are causing issues, reexamine that relationship. If the other person doesn't like to listen to you (or doesn't communicate in a way compatible to your style), then it's time to seriously ask yourself if this is the right person 11. Cherish the moments when you're alone. Relationships aren't formed by two wholes that become one, but of two wholes that are shared and add something to each other. I think that once we understand this, we stop putting so much pressure and expectations on someone. After all, we're only human beings, and we have to learn to live in a relationship without negating ourselves and without invading the other person's individuality. 12. And remember: Patience is key. "Be patient and think before you speak. Be willing to improve, think about the other person, and consider the relationship when you're making any kind of plans. Recognize that you make mistakes, they make mistakes, and that it's all okay, as long as we're willing to improve.





The sooner you talk about this in a relationship the better. Honestly, it sounds like you’ve already had an opportunity to be open about this and you didn’t take it. That’s a mistake, NAG. I understand the hesitation to tell her—it’s not exactly a first date ice breaker for most people—but there are some things you seriously need to consider here before you go hiding this any longer.

First off, you’re not giving her any benefit of the doubt. You’re assuming that disagreeing about this one issue means you can’t eventually find some middle ground, or simply “agree to disagree.” Yes, guns are a very hot topic right now, and she once said she wants to “take your guns,” but did you ever stop to think that maybe you can educate her and possibly convince her to rethink her stance to something less extreme? You have an opportunity to open up dialogue here where you can both learn something about the other side. Maybe in her mind all guns are nothing but killing machines—not the hunting, target-shooting, heirlooms they are to you. Being anti-gun doesn’t have to mean being anti-all-guns the same way that being pro-gun doesn’t have to mean being pro-all-guns. And if it really is a deal-breaker for either of you, there’s no point in wasting your time, right? Now, when you do finally bring this up, NAG, explain how you see your guns and what they mean to you. Be honest about your stance on owning firearms, and how you don’t want to see a blanket removal of them because [reasons]. Tell her that you use and store your firearms safely with gun locks and all that jazz (hopefully you do), and tell her how you acquired them (knowing they were all acquired legally might dissuade some discomfort). In the end, she might be more understanding of an heirloom hunting rifle that belonged to your great grandfather than an AR-15 with an extended clip and bump stock.

Look, it may not work out. If she’s that passionate about the topic, she might take off the minute you tell her you’re a gun owner. But being honest about who you are and what you believe is the right thing to do when you’re dating. In the future, you don’t necessarily have to open with your stance on guns during the first date or anything like that, but if it comes up naturally in conversation like it did with this gal, don’t hide the truth.







5. YOU WON’T “LOSE YOURSELF” AFTER GETTING MARRIED—YOU CAN MAINTAIN YOUR INDEPENDENCE
My person and I have always been pretty independent. We’re super happy together, but we’re also both super busy—we work a lot, travel a lot, and have our own friends. I worried that once I got married my single or unmarried friends would consider me kind of ineligible for hangouts, or I’d suddenly have to run every social decision I made by my husband—none of this has happened. It sort of goes back to the second point, but if you were independent and valued your personal time before getting married, odds are you’ll have that freedom after.

I know some couples that are just totally obsessed with each other, talk about each other constantly, and do every single thing together—and that’s great! But if that’s not your M.O., you can still have a totally happy, healthy, super fun marriage.

1. THE “MARRIAGE IS HARD” THING DOESN’T MEAN WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS
I’ve heard that marriage is hard or marriage takes work so many times, so I was prepared for a mostly comfortable and easy relationship to turn into something that felt like a grind as soon as we said “I do.”

And while, yes, it does take work, and you do have to prioritize each other, it’s not as hard as I thought it was going to be, and it’s not the kind of hard I was expecting. It’s more like now that you’ve made that commitment to each other (in front of your family and friends), you’re really in. You can’t just throw up your hands and say “fuck it!” any time you get into a big fight. You have no choice but to work through it.

At the same time, you’ve already committed to each other, so unless something is such a massive issue that you might get divorced over it, there’s not really as much of a point in fighting over it. Hopefully your personal boundaries have already been established before you get married, so the push-and-pull isn’t as crucial, and you can just let the little things go. It’s actually pretty fabulous.




Often the partner is like, ‘What’s the big deal?’, and that feels like a slap in the face,” Dr. Berman told POPSUGAR. “So, even if they don’t know why every candle in the house has to match, if they facilitate and assist, that is an act of real love and romance because it shows that even if they don’t understand it or think it’s important, it’s important to you, so they’re engaging and investing in it.”

Dr. Berman continued to say how your initial reaction may be to try to talk your partner out of it — like stressing over matching candles, in this instance — or to respond to their irritation with anger. But as you probably already know, reacting in those ways rarely ends well. Real love, as she mentioned, is demonstrated by small acts of appreciation. The fact that you have zero interest in candles is not the point here. By putting aside your own opinions (or lack thereof) on something your partner clearly does care about, you’re showing how much you value them and your relationship.

“It’s really important that each of you take responsibility for the bar that you’re setting and the unnecessary stress that you’re creating,” Dr. Berman said.

So the next time you catch yourself rolling your eyes or questioning your SO, pitch in instead. Don’t get annoyed that they want to watch sports or bad reality TV — take it as an opportunity to spend time together. Seeing things from a different perspective will greatly benefit your relationship!


great, but after a while, you came down off the high and began to feel estranged or distant. Don't give up quite yet. This is not necessarily the end of a good relationship and certainly isn't the only tell-tale sign you should move on. It may simply be the time to strengthen your foundation of emotional intimacy.

What is emotional intimacy in a relationship? It is the deep sense of being connected to one another. It is feeling loved, respected, and appreciated while at the same time seeking to reciprocate.

To feel loved is to have the sense that the other person genuinely cares about your well-being. Respect has to do with feeling the other person has a positive regard for your personhood, intellect, abilities, and personality. Appreciation is the inner sense that he or she values your contribution to the relationship.

If there is genuine love, respect, and appreciation, then you will experience emotional unity



Commit to being a better partner.
The best thing you can do for her – and for you – is to become the best version of yourself. Grow, learn and work on improving yourself. Work on eliminating bad habits and becoming emotionally stronger and more vulnerable.
You may be doing a lot of personal development work, but also work on becoming a better partner in your relationship. Read books on becoming a better man, attend workshops about being a better partner and try counseling if you think it will help you work through old patterns and harmful tendencies.

When you commit to becoming a better version of yourself, women get the benefits of a better you. Healing your emotional wounds, becoming a better listener, and being more present in your life are all big wins for her.



And even though they work together, they still make time to "debrief," something they recommend in the Gottman couples workshops. It involves listening to your partner talk about what anything stressful or interesting that happened to them that day.

What they don't do on a regular basis? Spend a lot of time talking about the relationship itself. Instead, they "take the temperature" of their relationship all the time.

Carrie said, "We feel positively about each other and we feel positively about the relationship and we feel supported. And when we don't, it is such an abrupt kind of difference that it feels so uncomfortable that we work to fix it."





Sussman, a relationship therapist and marriage counselor in New York City, told me that opposites may attract initially — but over time, too much difference can start to wear on a romantic bond. She said:

"Oftentimes the problems that you start to have early on when you're dating that you might not pay attention to, or you might brush them under the rug or say, ‘Oh, that's not so bad; we'll get through that,' then add 10 years of marriage into that, and all of a sudden all those things that were bothering you when you were dating seem to be major deal breakers … where you are considering: Do you want to go forward? Do you still want to be with this person?"

She added: "The way I see it is, opposites attract and with the passage of time, a lot of couples tend to resent the things that are opposite."

Sussman used a hypothetical example of a couple in which one partner is highly social and outgoing and the other is more of a homebody. Initially those tendencies might complement each other, Sussman said; the couple might even say, "we balance each other out."

The problem is, Sussman said, over time "people get more set in their ways" and there's less opportunity for compromise or mutual understanding.



I used to think that if my husband had an ounce of common sense, he would know what I wanted. For instance, when he came home after working a 12-hour day and found me and the baby home with the stomach flu, I assumed he already knew the answer to the question, “Can I go for a bike ride?” He didn’t. If I didn’t say, “No,” he would leave me there, tossing chunks while I cleaned up baby poop.

You really can’t assume that your spouse knows how you feel or what you want. You don’t share the same feelings, worldview or thoughts. You might notice the dishes in the sink or remember that the kids haven’t done their homework yet, but he might not. When in doubt, say it out loud.



Most of us make resolutions to improve only ourselves: We vow to cut out sugar, work out three days a week, dust off the resume and start the job hunt for real. In general, resolutions tend to be very me-focused—willpower, weight loss, self-care.

But what if we resolved to do good things for our relationships, like resolving to go dancing more or even to spend more time on the couch together? Research shows that getting your partner on board when you’re trying to get healthy is a huge predictor of success, so why not also make a deal that you’re going to shape up your love life, too? If you’re both committed to improving your relationship, you’ve just upped your chances that you’ll end 2018 with a stronger bond than you started with.




Because he knows how much it means to you, so he’s willing to do it despite his own possible feelings of discomfort. 10. Takes a genuine interest in your passions, even if he doesn’t understand them.

He actively discusses your hobbies and loves with you because he realizes they are a huge part of who you are and what makes you tick. He wants to step inside your mind, not just your body. Even when it’s totally not his fault. He hates arguing with you and never wants to see you upset. 13. Speaks openly with you about the future. He’s not afraid to talk about the future and your place within it because he is 100% committed to this relationship. 14. Answers any question you ask him with honesty.

Even when he knows it’s not what you’re hoping to hear, he will be as honest as he can while doing his best not to hurt your feelings. Because he knows that in the long run, the truth is always best. 15. He makes time for you every day.

No matter how busy he might be he always allows room for quality time with you in his hectic schedule. Because everyone is busy but we make time for the things and people who are important to us. 18. Gives you your own space when you need it.

He understands you have a healthy, happy life outside of him and he recognizes the importance of alone time for you both to reflect and rejuvenate.

19. Cheers you on, no matter how small the win.

He’s the person you tell first when anything good happens to you, because you know he’s always happy and proud of every single one of your achievements.





Someone once asked me, "Gary, I struggle with loving other people as they always disappoint. How can I work on this?"

I replied, "The only way to avoid being hurt is to stay away from relationships."

The reality is that there is going to be pain, hurt, and disappointment in all human relationships. This is because we are imperfect. None of us are loving all the time. We are, by nature, self-centered. Consequently, we hurt each other—most of the time unintentionally. The fact is that if you're going to have relationships, you're going to have times that you will be hurt. You have to accept that. Then, when you do feel hurt or wronged, you lovingly confront the perceived wrongdoer and try to work through that difficulty so the relationship can continue.

 After that initial text, we didn’t discuss the parameters of our new relationship, so I felt pretty unsure about specifics. Did she just want to have sex with other people? What about consistently dating? I decided I'd rather not know. I thought I could handle it better if I didn’t get the details. And to be honest, I didn’t really care about the "rules" — I knew deep down that I'd remain monogamous no matter what happened.

I thought I’d feel "accomplished" by finally participating in our open relationship and sleeping with someone other than Grace, but it only made me feel empty and far away from myself. It felt so counterintuitive to everything I wanted out of a relationship: loyalty, honesty, commitment. My situation with Grace was destroying me. But still, I said nothing. 

I DIDN'T JUDGE GRACE FOR WANTING AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP, BUT IT WAS FINALLY CLEAR TO ME: AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP JUST DIDN'T SUIT ME.
My self-esteem plummeted. Insecurities I didn’t even know I had began to regularly plague me. I went from being obsessively jealous of other women to just feeling flat-out heartbroken. Sometimes, I lashed out at her for seeing other people, but after all, it was what I had agreed to. I felt like I'd done this to myself. I thought I had to suffer in silence. If I wanted to be with Grace, the sacrifice I would make was not opening my mouth about how uncomfortable I felt.

This relationship wasn’t healthy for me, obviously. But it wasn’t healthy for Grace, either. She was comfortable and happy in an open relationship, and she deserved to be with someone who would be equally as comfortable and happy. So I broke up with her on Valentine's Day. She'd come over with a handmade book, and in it, had listed everything she loved about me. After reading the first page, the flood gates burst open. I — sob — can't — sob — d-do this anymore, I cried. It didn’t matter that she had made me a lovey-dovey gift. It meant nothing in comparison to how sh*tty I felt all the time.

I had been gearing up to break off the relationship for awhile, but I hadn't planned to do it right then. The gift set me off. Reading how much she loved me made me feel even worse. It all felt so fake and I exploded.

I'd finally come to terms with the fact that I only wanted to be with one person who only wanted to be with me. I was sure of this now. I didn't judge Grace for wanting an open relationship, but it was finally clear to me: an open relationship just didn't suit me.

After months of fighting the voice in my head, I'd learned that when you're not being honest with your partner about your boundaries, you're hurting both of you. Grace was (and is) an autonomous person who, like me, deserves to explore her sexuality and do what she wants. I shouldn't have stuck around to make both of us feel bad about that. Dating Grace was a huge lesson in acknowledging and respecting my own personal boundaries. I realized I'll no longer change myself and my comfort level for partners. Yes, her choices were completely valid and worthy of respect, but my voice mattered too.

Open relationships work for some people and I think it’s incredible. For me, I know now that I just don’t want to share the person I love with anyone. Thanks to Grace and our relationship, I learned that I deserve to honor who I am and what I want.

Maybe I'm a boring, monogamous lesbian. But I'm damn proud of it.



The average marriage declines in happiness over time starting pretty soon after the wedding day. If you just look back and wait and see how it goes, it's likely to get worse. John F. Kennedy, when talking about the economy, said that "The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining." I would tell a newlywed who's just getting married: Don't wait until it's time to seek marital therapy. Be proactive about making the relationship a bit stronger. In other words, marriage is not something you have, it's something you do — so act accordingly.

How much success in marriage hinges on choosing the right partner and how much of it hinges on laziness and a failure to tend to the relationship? I do think that sometimes people get divorced and end up happier because of it, and that’s probably not very rare. Or people often get divorced and meet someone else that makes them happier. So I wouldn’t tell people to “stick it out” if they’re miserable in their marriage.

On the other hand, there's something pretty great about building and sustaining a long-term marriage, growing old together, watching your kids have kids. I don't have an answer to your question other than to suggest that people should work hard to try to make the marriage as strong as possible, and if there comes a point where they say, "We do nothing but work. It's just nothing but work, and it's not fulfilling," then they might need to consider plan B.

I’ve always objected to this idea that the best wife or husband is the one who helps you become the best version of yourself. I think the best partner is the one who helps you transcend yourself, who draws you out of yourself. I guess that’s why I always hated that line from Jerry Maguire, “You complete me.” To me that’s narcissism, not love. Remember that the modern marriage is not just about what I get; it's also, and more importantly, about what I give. We're looking for a marriage to help us with our self-expression and personal growth. I believe that the majority of us have an understanding that that's a two-way street. I think a reasonably good metric is something like this: We’ve spent years really trying to make the marriage work. Both of us have tried, and we don't seem to be able to get aligned. The issue at this point seems to be less about good will and effort, and more about a fundamental incompatibility. That is, the life you want to lead is incompatible with the life that I want to lead. That's when I think people should seriously consider that they might be better off apart.

We're asking less when it comes to things at the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy of needs — basic things like security and safety. What I think we don't really appreciate these days is that 200 years ago, people literally looked to marriage for food, clothing, and shelter. It was precarious to live if you weren’t married. We need marriage less in those ways than we did before. Our expectations are lower in those ways, but they're higher in emotional and psychological sorts of ways.

Today, the basic needs of life aren’t enough. These days love and belonging isn’t even enough. Now we want a sense of personal growth, personal betterment, from our marriage.





rust is the foundation of every relationship. She had friends before you came into her life. Is there a reason for her to leave them on your arrival?




How to have a hard conversation

Call out the elephant in the room. In Ms. de Cadenet’s book, she outlines a conversation she had with a friend who confessed to her that she was sleeping with a married man. To have a difficult talk, Ms. de Cadenet starts by acknowledging the awkwardness. “Just say, ‘This is really uncomfortable for both of us. This is not a conversation I want to have. And I know you don’t. But I think we have to talk about this,’” she said.





your fixation might be a form of self-sabotage, Dr. Brustein says. “There are times when somebody might be doing this to rationalize getting out of [a relationship],” he says. Again, this most likely stems from an insecurity that your partner is still connected with their ex or that you’re never going to measure up to their past partners.
The good news is that, in most cases, your stress and worries about your partner’s ex will eventually go away, but it might require some introspective reflection, and possibly a conversation with your partner. “It’s really important to realize that in a relationship, people evolve over time, and what was once a suitable partner in somebody’s past may not be fitting for their present — and you’re in the present,” Dr. Brustein says. “You have to keep in mind that it’s not about better or worse, it’s about fitting, and you fit now.” Your partner’s ex is an ex for a reason: because something in their relationship didn’t work. In some ways, you might want to thank or acknowledge your partner’s previous relationship, because it ultimately brought you and your partner together, Dr. Brustein says. “Who they are now is impacted by what they learned from their previous relationship, and the reason they might have chosen you is because of something from their past that didn’t work,” he says. Look at your partner’s past relationship as a blessing, and appreciate what your partner learned, and who they are now — not who their ex is and what they represent.



It's been awhile.. I forgot what this felt like. That place in between love and lust. I was never good at this relationship thing. I wasn't the type of girl who grew up wanting a marriage, kids, and a home. No, I dreamed of having my own condo or high rise. I'd have a great career, dinner alone, never, ever settling down. Becoming a wife is one thing. Becoming a mom is another. And here I am, between forever and always. It's not that I'm not happy, because I am. I'm just not satisfied. Women dream of this shit, the housewife life. And me, I dreamed of late night, take out, staring at the stars, talking about sexual experiences and what the universe was truly like. People don't get that. They're so quick to think life has to be this monogamous relationship where you end up having kids, a home, and well, life just stays plateau. I'll never settle for that. That was never the life I wanted for myself. I was a free soul who belonged to no one. To be with me was to be without me....



7. Appreciate what you have

At the end of the day, you must never stop letting your partner know how grateful you are to have them in your life - the easiest way is simply to tell them how much they mean to you. It sounds obvious but is all too easy to forget, Preece points out.

“Buy them a small gift or cook them a meal ‘just because.’ It’s the little gestures that will help you hold on to the happiness you have.”



Never before have our expectations of marriage taken on such epic proportions. We still want everything the traditional family was meant to provide—security, respectability, property, and children—but now we also want our partner to love us, to desire us, to be interested in us. We should be best friends and trusted confidants, and passionate lovers to boot.

Contained within the small circle of the wedding band are vastly contradictory ideals. We want our chosen one to offer stability, safety, predictability, and dependability. And we want that very same person to supply awe, mystery, adventure, and risk. We expect comfort and edge, familiarity and novelty, continuity and surprise. We have conjured up a new Olympus, where love will remain unconditional, intimacy enthralling, and sex oh so exciting, with one person, for the long haul. And the long haul keeps getting longer.

We also live in an age of entitlement; personal fulfillment, we believe, is our due. In the West, sex is a right linked to our individuality, our self-actualization, and our freedom. Thus, most of us now arrive at the altar after years of sexual nomadism. By the time we tie the knot, we’ve hooked up, dated, cohabited, and broken up. We used to get married and have sex for the first time. Now we get married and stop having sex with others. The conscious choice we make to rein in our sexual freedom is a testament to the seriousness of our commitment. By turning our back on other loves, we confirm the uniqueness of our “significant other”: “I have found The One. I can stop looking.” Our desire for others is supposed to miraculously evaporate, vanquished by the power of this singular attraction.




Marriage also smacks you in the face with what’s really important in life. Sure, hanging out and partying are fun. But too many people get stuck in this phase and miss the meaning that comes from building a life with someone.

You will never find a better personal development seminar or book than marriage. It will highlight all of your flaws and weaknesses, challenging you to become a better person than you ever thought possible.

Said Thomas Monson, “Choose your love; love your choice.” After you’ve chosen the person you love, love them. You don’t marry to make yourself happy, you marry to make someone else happy. Said Frankl in Man’s Search for Meaning, “For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself.”



Being faithful means being honest with your person about the fact that you ran into your ex during your lunch break or that some girl at the bar asked you for your number. It means being open, even when the truth makes you uncomfortable, because you believe that your person deserves to know what really happened. Being faithful means knowing what your person is not okay with, what they would consider being disloyal, and never crossing that line. Remember, being faithful means more than never letting another person into your bed. It means never letting another person in your heart. Being faithful means deciding that your love for this one person outweighs your desire to be with any other person on the planet. It means that you’ve decided you’ve found the person you’re meant to spend the rest of your life with and you aren’t going to do anything to mess it up




Men often need to process what they are feeling. They don’t know what they are thinking until they’ve done some long, hard pondering. A husband may retreat during conflict so he can think through what he’s feeling before he accidentally says something hurtful.

Women sometimes have to talk through things to really understand what they are feeling. Those feelings like to hide under the surface until she can express them verbally. When her husband leaves mid conversation, it cuts that opportunity for her.


We have a 10 month old now. My husband really struggles with simplifying – he believes so strongly in his duty to provide which is constantly at odds with the limited amount of time we have together. He justifies it as “securing our future by sacrificing today” and I see it as “sacrificing today means having a broken relationship in the future”. It's tough and not as easy as it seems. I’m glad you’ve retired before having a baby, I look forward to the day we are retired and can choose the time we spend with our kid while also being true to ourselves as individuals.






My partner is this task of living has doubled every joy and halved every defeat.


The second that you smiled at me, it was all over. I was locked on you. Attached to the idea of you.

It’s not because I'm shallow. I didn’t get attached, because of the intensity of your eyes or the shape of your body.

She got attached, because I saw something in you. A flicker of faith. A future.




“Life is too short to be in relationships where you feel this isn’t fully right or somebody doesn’t have your back, or somebody doesn’t fully value you,”


Although I really do love sharing photos of my husband on my Facebook and Instagram, we also had a very serious talk before we got married where I told him it was important to me to keep our relationship sacred. What I meant by this was that I never wanted to be the couple badmouthing each other to our friends, even just in jest. I wanted to be a united team, at all times, and make sure other people knew it.



8. Use Their Love Language

Realizing that we don't all love and want to be loved the same exact way is really important in long-term relationships.

Love Languages are a tool to help you and your partner discover the ways each of you communicates best in love. There are five different styles: words of affirmation, acts of service, receiving gifts, quality time, and physical touch. Essentially, the love languages help each of you better connect in your relationship by providing love in the way that it's needed.

My husband and I took the love languages test early on in our relationship. His primary love language is physical touch, which means he likes to be cuddled and close all the time. Mine is words of affirmation, which means I like hearing him say nice things. It's helped us understand each other tremendously.

By learning your partner's love language, you'll show that you truly want to know as much about them as possible and give them what they needed emotionally.




9. Grow With Them

No relationship stays static over time, so one of the best ways to make sure your partner wants to be with you for the long haul is to continue to grow with them.

Growing with your partner means continuing to do the things they're interested in, supporting their new hobbies and habits, and constantly putting yourselves in new and different situations so that you have things to adapt to and talk about.

My husband and I are big fans of doing anything wild that comes our way, from a body painting adventure we did to our next international trip. It keeps our marriage fresh, alive, and consistently moving forward.

Growing in the relationship will make your partner feel like they have a true companion in life and it'll ensure they want to hold on to you forever.

Every couple is different, but the happiest and most successful couples have a lot in common. Doing these things will make your partner feel loved, accepted, supported, and valued, and it'll help you keep a long and happy relationship with them.




After a few years together, it’s easy to bicker with your partner over mundane stuff. Nitpicking each other about the minute details of daily life can feel involuntary—you know you’re being unreasonable and crabby, but it’s just so hard to stop yourself in the moment





I have to tell you, I’m difficult to love .. You may give me compliments and I might find them difficult to believe, please, remind me of the good in me anyway.

You can find the beauty amidst my flaws and I’d still see imperfections, please, see the beauty in me anyway.

When you listen to my negative thoughts, you might find it difficult to handle, please, listen to them and be patient with me anyway. .. I hope you understand that in this relationship, there will be downsides. But I promise you good days.

When I push you away, please stay. Remind me to talk—no not just merely talk, I want us to communicate. The difference between talking and communicating is that the latter involves empathy whilst the other, the lack thereof.



He or she is all you can think about.
You love spending your free time with them.
Every little thing reminds you of them.
You don't mind making small sacrifices or doing favors for them. You feel like you're almost addicted to them. They're the first person you want to tell news to.
You catch yourself planning ahead with them in mind.
Everything feels right when you're with him or her.
You're willing to try new things for them.
You genuinely feel for them when they're sad.
You miss them as soon as they leave.
There's no one else you'd rather be with.







Get on Board With Scheduled Sex

Endlessly spontaneous sex is the dream for most couples, but the reality is that it isn’t typically sustainable in the long term. When you’re dating someone brand new, you’re willing to make incredible sacrifices in your life to make space for that person. As time goes on, life catches up. Most of us are so busy we don’t have time to spontaneously read a book, much less spontaneously have sex. For many couples, scheduling sex is the only way to ensure that they actually have sex. Yes, it’s sad to recognize how complicated it can be to make the space for sex. It’s OK to mourn your old sex life, but don’t let that prevent you from creating a new sex life.

Thank Each Other

Maintaining an active sex life takes a lot of work! It’s important for you and your partner to acknowledge and thank each other for that work. After each sex date, take a few minutes to thank your partner for being willing to put in that effort with you. Be specific about how that effort made you feel. For example, “I feel so close to you when we carve out this time for each other.” We all love being recognized and validated for our efforts. Plus, taking the time to thank each other will help you recognize that you’re working together as a team to create the sex life you both want.


Treating a girl right means motivating her, inspiring her. Telling her that you believe in her. Pushing her to go to that interview or try out for that team when she’s on the fence about whether or not she should put herself out there.

Treating a girl right means doing little things for her. Leaving love notes for her to find around the house. Setting her alarm when she forgets to do it herself. Doing the dishes when you know she’s going to get home late.

Treating a girl right means involving her in your life. Waiting a few extra days to catch up on a show so that you can watch it together. Inviting her to eat dinner with your parents on their birthdays. Adding her to the group chat with your best friends.

Treating a girl right means showing up when it matters. Being there for her whenever she’s feeling blue. Attending her family’s reunions and holiday parties. Visiting her during her lunch break when your schedules have been too hectic to see each other much.

Treating a girl right means really letting her into your life. Sticking the photos and letters she gave you onto your fridge. Posting pictures of your dates on social media. Letting her leave her toothbrush and her clothes all over your apartment.

Treating a girl right means memorizing her. Remembering the names of her aunts and uncles. Knowing what makes her smile and what makes her uncomfortable. Being able to list off her favorite movies and snacks and nail polish colors without even having to think about it.

Treating a girl right means opening up to her. Telling her about the rough parts of your past. Letting her see you with tears in your eyes. Giving her pieces of yourself you’ve never given another person.

Treating a girl right means grouping together. Acting like she’s your teammate. Asking for her help to pick out new curtains or a car instead of doing it yourself. Referring to the dog and the bed and the house as ours instead of mine.

Treating a girl right means being affectionate. Holding her hand at the movies. Cuddling her after sex. Saying that you love her every chance you get because you never get tired of those words.

Treating a girl right means treating her like your family. Like your equal. Like your best friend in the world. 


Show him how much you’re crushing it at life.

There’s nothing hotter than a girl that’s in control of her own life. Whether you get that flow from successful workouts at the gym or killing a presentation at work, skill, talent and confidence are sexy as hell.

Let your crush take this all in. It’s


For me personally, I’ve never become more in tune with myself until a woman I really liked broke my heart. Working out, eating well and writing in a journal kept me busy. I kept up with my schedule; work out in the mornings before work, eating clean, doing my hobbies, even though I didn’t want to. But what emerged was a man who was comfortable being uncomfortable; who isn’t afraid to be vulnerable like he once was and who is open to trying it again with someone else in the future. I didn’t let heartbreak defeat me. But I did let it help define me into the person I am currently. So yes, I understand why many run from commitment; the fear of heartbreak is real. But, I wonder if they truly know themselves while standing in their present comfort zones.




7. Being unprecedentedly honest – never filtering what’s really on your mind.

Your secrets. Your goals. Your dreams. Your fears. Your greatest flaws. Your biggest failures. Your weakest moments. Opening yourself up completely to someone else is one of the scariest things you can do. It’s the reason why those conversations make you feel more intimate with your partner than you do during sex or during a romantic date or anything else in the world. You know each other. You know the parts of each other that suck and the parts of each other that you keep hidden and the parts of each other that you’re each ashamed of. And you love each other anyway. And that’s the real reason you’re so happy together.



It’s always unexpected. Finally, you have a Saturday where neither one of you has any plans or obligations. You sleep in, maybe get some brunch or run some errands. Eventually you return home and somehow you both gravitate towards the bed. You meant to just warm up under the covers for a few minutes t’s almost dark again when you wake back up, but you make no rush to do anything, because their arm is around you and the warmth is just too good to turn away.



You look down at one point and notice your fingers entwined. You have no idea how long they’ve been like that. It could have just happened or you could have been holding hands for the last 6 days. Your bodies are so comfortable with each other that touching one another has become a completely natural thing for you at this point. You don’t even think about it. You’re reading a book and they’re watching tv or you’re driving in the car or you’re walking down the street. And all the while, your hands are always reaching out, searching for each other.



3. You’ll think he’s too good to be true.

Someone treating you this well has got to be too good to be true. You’re expecting the other shoe to drop. You’re expecting him to lose it one day. You’re expecting some abrupt ending without closure. But every day he just proves to you he’s the same person he’s been from the start. He’s given you no reason to question him but it isn’t him you don’t trust it’s everyone in the past.

5. You’re going to expect fights.

You keep waiting for a fight. But instead, everything gets talked out and explained. And there’s this wave of comfort afterward and you realize normal people don’t leave the second something goes wrong.




6. Going out of your way to surprise each other in little ways, as often as possible.

Nothing spectacular or over-the-top. Just simple, unexpected surprises that make your significant other smile. Sometimes you run into the drug store to pick up a prescription while they wait in the car, and you come out with their favorite candy, just because you love watching their face light up over something so small. Or they purposefully leave their favorite sweatshirt at your place because they know how much you love wearing it. You never have to do anything big. It’s always sweet, little gifts that manage to make your entire day.



9. Sincerely feeling as though their happiness is your happiness (and doing things to facilitate that).

You love getting up before them and making them a cup of coffee before you leave for work. They love to cook you dinner, even if it’s just scrambled eggs, when you’re exhausted and hungry. You find it to be one of the most intimate feelings in the world – the fact that you’re happiest when you’re putting someone else before yourself, trying to make them smile and make their world just a little bit easier.


People are out there living their ideas of glamorous lives. They’re getting bottle service at clubs and attending exclusive wine tastings and dancing around at EDM concerts. But you’re standing over the stove together, watching water boil and feeling more content than you ever have before. Other people are out wearing bandage dresses and 3-piece suits. But the two of you are all pajama pants and t-shirts and fuzzy socks and sweatshirts, and you’ve never been more attracted to each other. One of you is cutting up peppers while the other one works on the pasta. And even though it’s the simplest thing and the simplest night, you feel the foundations of a steady partnership, and right now that’s all you need.



plit a late-night pizza and compliment each other and feel so thankful in this moment that you’ve found someone so wonderful.



It depends. I believe you can find out a lot about a person by the way they talk about past relationships. How they may view certain actions that a former significant other did. Everything in our past has led up to where we are now so if she learned something about a past relationship, absolutely I want to hear about it.



“Whenever someone would ask us who was boss I would say that I let him think he was boss, then he would look upward with his eyes as if he was the one who was letting me think I was boss. The truth was, we were partners. It was us against the world. Talk to each other all the time about everything so little things don’t become major issues. Play with your partner because you are best friends and really enjoy each others company. Never say the word divorce in a moment of anger. Tell you partner you love them, EVERY DAY.”



“When you wake up in the morning, think ‘What can I do to make her day or his day just a little happier?’ You need to turn toward each other, and if you focus on the other person even just for that five minutes when you first wake up, it’s going to make a big difference in your relationship. That’s likely to really work for many years. So start each day thinking about what you can give that special person in your life.” 


“No matter what comes at you in your relationship, (or in life) it is never you against your spouse. It is ALWAYS you and your spouse against the issue. Often we get caught up in placing blame and designating responsibility to only one person. However, when you are in a marriage, you have made a commitment to become ‘one’, and you are to tackle all issues as a unit.”



It was the single best decision he would ever make. (ove)

You miss the strangest things when you lose someone. Little things. Smiles. The way she turned over in her sleep. Even repainting a room for her.

Of all the imaginable things he most misses about her, the thing he really wishes he could do again is hold her hand in his.


His days passed like this, slow and methodical. And then one morning he saw her. She had brown hair and blue eyes and red shoes and a big yellow clasp in her hair. And then there was no more peace and quiet for Ove.


They make their love known. And they let you know it’s not going anywhere, that they’re not going anywhere. And even when you have a hard time believing them, their actions outweigh your doubts, and you can’t do anything but believe them. They make you realize that the reason they continue to stay is because they love being with you, and they love every little thing about you, even the things you don’t like about yourself.


Grief is like the ocean; it comes on waves ebbing and flowing. Sometimes the water is calm, and sometimes it is overwhelming. All we can do is learn to swim. ~ Vicki Harrison



You each have your own independence (that you enjoy).

You love each other, there’s no question about that, but loving someone doesn’t mean your world revolves around theirs. You both have lives outside of one another, hobbies and interests and places you go that that you don’t go together. That’s okay. You’re a part of their world, and they’re a part of yours, but they’re not always going to be around, and they don’t have to be, and when this is something you both understand you know you’ve met someone who’s worth it.

You miss them when they’re gone.

Even though you both are capable of being apart, you still miss each other when you are. They’re the person you love coming home to. They’re the person who embodies the idea of home for you that isn’t necessarily a place.

They make their love known. And they let you know it’s not going anywhere, that they’re not going anywhere. And even when you have a hard time believing them, their actions outweigh your doubts, and you can’t do anything but believe them. They make you realize that the reason they continue to stay is because they love being with you, and they love every little thing about you, even the things you don’t like about yourself.

The one who is certain of you and his career and a future he wants you apart of.

The one who says I love you first just because he wants you to know. Stay single until you meet a guy who is sure of you and never makes you doubt how he feels.





“Spending time with your partner should be less work than spending time with anyone else...

“I find it easier to do chores, go on long drives, watch Netflix, or whatever with my wife than with anyone else, or even by myself. Of course, I still spend plenty of time with my friends and by myself. (If you feel like you aren’t getting to do those things enough, that’s another red flag of a bad relationship.) And my wife and I definitely get on each other’s nerves sometimes. But there’s almost never a time when I don’t want to hang out with my wife. I almost never get sick of seeing her.”



“You definitely weren’t the only one to leave the party with a broken heart that night,” she told me. “I burst into tears the second I got home. I was beyond confused. I went from feeling so bad for hurting you to guilty for not feeling the same and then angry at you for putting me in that situation.” Talk about who you’re dating, do group activities rather than one-on-one, don’t get touchy-feely or flirtatious over social media or texts and definitely don’t let him do tons of favors for you, helping out with work. If you think you're in the friend zone, you're probably not my friend: In reality, the friend zone devalues the very thing it references: friendship. Its view of sex suggests that platonic friendship is some sort of penalty box, rather than a relationship one should feel thankful and excited for. True friends appreciate their connection and honor each other's company. And friends respect, rather than undermine, each other's decisions.



I have absolutely no problems taking her out on dates and footing the bill 100% but we’ve been on about 5 dates and we’ve hung out with mutual friends on numerous occasions, but she never even offers to pay – not even a disingenuous offer. I understand that if we are happy, then money is a small price to pay, but I barely finished college and only make $40,000 a year. I cannot afford to spend $200 every weekend. I mean, even when we’re not on dates, she expects me to pay. I don’t know how she got this old fashioned mindset, but it’s really starting to bug me. Personally, I work just as hard as she does for my money and I don’t find it fair but at the same time, I find it too early in the relationship to bring it up. I just don’t want her getting the idea that I’m ok with it or that she can take advantage.
 

I don’t even expect her to pay half. If we go out to dinner, I’ll pay for the date and the dinner, but the least she could do is pay for our ice cream or maybe buy me a single drink? I want to have that feeling, like if we’re at a bar and my girl comes up to me and asks me what I want. It’s like she has my back. It’s not about the cash- it’s more about being appreciated and not taken advantage of. I do not know how to approach the situation. I know she is going to explode if I bring it up, but how much of this should I take? I am not cheap, but at the same time, I am not made out of money. Does it make me a bad person to be thinking this way? I am somewhat of a liberal, progressive thinker, and her traditional mindset seems backwards to me




It’s not difficult to make a woman feel special. In fact, it’s usually the little things she appreciates most, because they let her know you truly care. When couples have been together for a long time, they often grow apart. It happens to the best of us, but it doesn’t have to be that way. You can show your woman just how much you care by doing little things to make her happy and keep the relationship alive.

When you take the first step toward showing your lady how much she means to you, you start a chain reaction that knows no end. She is sure to be so overwhelmed with love and gratitude for the thoughtfulness you’ve shown that she’ll return the love and affection.

It’s easy to forget that a good relationship doesn’t just happen. It takes WORK! There is more happiness to be found in a relationship when both partners believe that giving is much better than receiving, and that’s what this feature is all about.






Before we go about the exercise of figuring out the net worth of the above average couple, let’s take a moment to define an above average couple:

* Stays together for the long term.

* Discusses long term financial goals e.g. retirement age, retirement number, succession planning.

* Does not keep financial secrets.

* Knows their monthly budget like the back of their hand.

* Makes sure their net worth risk exposure is aligned with their goals.

* Shares expenses in a fair way.

* Supports each other’s careers and endeavors.

* Works together as a team to get things done.

* Seeks to understand the other side of a story during conflicts and always comes to a compromise.

* Plans for the financial expense of children even if they don’t have any.

* Each spouse can financially support themselves if the relationship ends.

* Only has children if they’ve run the numbers and know they can afford them.
