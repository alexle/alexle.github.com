There’s a tendency to think the marathon is the pinnacle of running—something that beginners should work up to and something that those who’ve been at it for years should have under their belts. The assumption is the longer the distance, the harder the race—effort is often forgotten. And I’ll admit that when I was first starting out, I fell into this way of thinking because it’s easy to see the 5K—just 3.1 miles—as no big deal. It’s a distance that people usually think of as a “fun run” or “great for someone who’s just beginning.” And it is. I’ve run many local 5Ks where there’s no pressure to run (or walk) at a certain pace.

But over the last year or so, I feel I’ve grown as a runner, slowly learning to be more confident in my abilities and opinions by training more, racing more, and surrounding myself with runners far more experienced than I am. And one of the things I’ve come to realize is that the marathon, while impressive in its own right, isn’t the be-all and end-all. In fact, a speedy 5K is far more impressive than the average finishing time for a marathon.




"I'm afraid of the 5k" “I’m afraid of the 5K,” confessed Laura, an experienced marathoner who’d asked me to coach her at shorter distances. “In the marathon, I have time to get my rhythm, but the 5K is like getting shot out of a cannon.”

It’s true that the 5K requires quickly accelerating to a pace that is 30–60 seconds per mile faster than the marathon. But it’s also true that improving your acceleration and your ability to run comfortably at 5K pace are easy fixes. A fast 5K requires the speed and strength of a miler combined with the endurance of a marathoner. Your brain is hardwired to prevent you from damaging your body with a dangerous effort. Therefore, you have to teach it that 5K races are safe. The easiest way to do that? Race a 5K! Many runners find that their second 5K is surprisingly easier and faster than their first, and the reason is largely because you know what to expect. Having felt the discomfort and anxiety that comes with running a 5K hard makes it slightly easier to run another one, as that familiarity (and continued training, of course) breeds confidence to continue pushing outside your comfort zone. As your training progresses and after you’ve raced a few 5Ks, you’ll acquire the ability to really attack the race, and that’s when your PR will really start to fall.
