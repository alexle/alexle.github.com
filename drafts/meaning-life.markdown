How to be motivated

For me, I have a hard time motivating myself on certain days. There are days I roll out of bed, rub my eyes, brush my teeth, and think to myself:

Why am I doing all this? Am I really helping others? What is the point of my life?

But the way I am able to overcome this is by thinking to myself:

If I can just help 1 other person, it is worth it.

I know that my life is bigger than me. The purpose I was put on this earth is to help others, not myself.

For myself, I know I often feel discouraged on social media when I don’t get ‘as many likes’ as I have in the past. But a new strategy: I imagine my follower-level or like-level at 0. And if I even get 1 like, or 1 new followers— I rejoice. Because I am reaching out to someone else, helping at least 1 other individual.




easily. ‘I don’t need to be a hero, Fool. I’d settle for feeling that what I did every day had significance to someone besides myself.’

They live from day to day, giving in to appetites and desires, convinced that what they do does not matter in the larger scheme of things.


Let me guess…

You often drag yourself to work and feel like everyday is the same.

Perhaps it feels like your life is on autopilot.

At moments you might even feel like your life is not very meaningful and you miss a clear sense of purpose.

You’ve probably asked yourself these questions countless times,
“Why am I here?”, “What’s the point of it all?” and “what am I meant to do with my life?”

At the end of the day, what you’re really looking for is to live a meaningful and purposeful life…a life that matters.

Am I right?

You’re worried that you’re going about your life the wrong way and that by the time you’re 50 or 60, you’ll have nothing but a deep sense of regret and unfulfilment.

It makes sense though. Because the truth is, we only get to live once.

So what makes a meaningful life and a life that matters?


We often ask ourselves “What am I supposed to do with my life or what is my purpose?”

The answer is in significance.

Everybody wants to leave their mark in this world. They want to be able to feel as though their life served a purpose, and usually that purpose is linked to having a valuable and significant impact in the world.

For some, it’s enough to simply make a valuable contribution to just one other person, and for others, they want to influence a whole community or even the world.

What is your significance?

What do you dream that you could do in this world? And what drives you?

To live a meaningful and fulfilling life, find out what matters most to you in this world and then choose to make an impact with it.
