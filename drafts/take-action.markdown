Take Action




Reading a book, listening to a podcast, or watching a video does only one thing  —  give you information. That’s it. Nothing else. And it is as good as watching the world news. It only gives you information.

Just as watching CNN and listening to what Donald Trump did in the past year doesn’t make you a politician who can run for office, listening to GaryVee, Tony Robbins, and Tim Ferriss   doesn’t make you intelligent, smart, special, or a success story.

I think what people fail to realize is that Knowledge is not Power. Application of knowledge is

Fine you have read a book  —  so now what?

I think people should maybe stop reading so many books and start doing something worthwhile in their lives.

What people need to understand is that yes, Gary Vaynerchuk, Tony Robbins and Tim Ferriss’s content is good. But here’s a newsflash  —  they have made millions of dollars selling their brand. What have you done? How have you ‘specifically’ changed your life in tangible terms? What ‘measurable’ progress have you made?





Appreciation
1. "One thing that you've taught me is" or "One thing that I've learned from you is"

2. "One thing that I appreciate about you/your company is..."

3. "You know better than most people/companies that..."

Scarcity
4. "I'm going to let you in on a secret..."

5. "You may already know this, but just in case you don't..."

6. "Because time is tight, you may want to consider..."

Bottom-Lining
7. "Here's what's most important about this for you..."

8. "Why you need to know this is..."

9. "Let me bottom-line this for you..."

Call to Action
10. "You may want to write this next part down..." 

11. "If you're only going to remember one thing, it should be..."

12. "If you're only going to do one thing, it should be..."







Some of the best opportunities in life involve risk—the possibility of rejection, embarrassment, or failure. It takes a lot of courage to roll the dice and face the consequences. Those who choose to pursue risky opportunities face no shortage of discouragers—people determined to argue that something can't be done or shouldn't be tried. These doom-and-gloom promoters can be pretty persuasive, especially if there's no one to counter their influence.

Cue the encourager.

Whether it's your spouse, significant other, child, parent, or friend, he or she has untapped potential in one or more areas of life. That potential may be awaiting your encouraging words. Encouragement requires empathy—seeing the world from another's perspective. In order to do this, we must first learn what is important to that person (so we don't force or pressure what we want). Only then can we give encouragement. With verbal encouragement, we're trying to communicate, "I know. I care. I'm with you. How can I help?" We're trying to show we believe in them and their abilities. We're giving credit and praise.

Most of us have more potential than we'll ever develop. What holds us back is often a lack of courage. A loving spouse, family member, or friend can supply that all-important catalyst.





What life do I want? In 5, 10, 40 years?
What areas of my life could be improved?
What’s my motivation?
What do I believe in?
What do I consider essential?
What does “meaningful” mean to me?
What makes me feel most satisfied at work?
What do I want to leave behind?
What do I enjoy?
When do I feel the most energized?
When do I feel the most successful?
What people do I admire, and why?
Do I enjoy spending time with the people I currently spend time with?





Recall when you were a kid and it was your birthday, or you were going camping or taking your first trip to Disneyland. By four-thirty in the morning, you were wide awake, so excited for the day to begin. That’s the feeling you need now! When what you do every day aligns closely with your values—when you know you’re making a difference to your organization and the customers it serves—you can’t wait for each day to begin. You’re up at four-thirty in the morning, without the alarm.

Rediscovering your passion and sense of purpose is the only ways to re-engage in your career. The good news is that there is passion in all of us, even if your last job squashed it. As you manage to reconnect to what you’re doing and why, your performance will improve. Not only will your current job become more satisfying, but you’ll improve your motivation—and your chances—to explore new job possibilities.



Is there something your partner has expressed a desire to do? Such as: lose weight, write an article, go back to school, or learn to ski? Why not encourage their dream? Many dreams are killed by a spouse or friend who says, “It’s not realistic.” “We can’t afford it.” “You won’t follow through.” Don’t be a dream-killer. Learn to speak encouraging words such as: “I know you can do it because you are an excellent writer.” “If you want to go back to school, we’ll find the money.” “If you decide to go on a diet, I’ll be happy to join you.” One encouraging statement can be the difference between success and failure. Remember, we give life or death to people’s dreams by what we say.


Actions you take beat life-changing intentions. Not doing anything is the same as intending to do something but never actually doing it.

“Small deeds done are better than great deeds planned” says Peter Marshall

Does it really matter if you wanted or really intended to do something, but ended up just not doing it?

Just thinking about something wont’t do you any good if you don’t actually do it. Every time you put something off, it’s put into a queue, and nearly everything in that order of things to do may NEVER get done.

You can never get real progress if you don’t take action. All of the self-help articles in the world can’t save you if you never take action. Every time you read a book or article like this, immediately apply something from it (no matter how big or small).

The only failure comes in not attempting. There is no actual failure in giving your all whatever the results.

Momentum comes through actions, so do something that moves you forwards. Even a small act is significant. Expiring knowledge catches more attention than it should, for two reasons. One, there’s a lot of it, eager to buzz our short attention spans. Two, we chase it down, anxious to squeeze out insight before it loses relevance.

Long-term knowledge is harder to notice because it’s buried in books rather than blasted in headlines. But its benefit is huge. It’s not just that long-term knowledge rarely expires, letting you accumulate it over time. It’s that compounds over time. Expiring knowledge tells you what happened; long-term knowledge tells you why something happened and is likely to happen again. That “why” can translate and interact with stuff you know about other topics, which is where the compounding comes in.






It¿s so easy to dream.

It¿s easy to tell people about your ambitions. It¿s easy to create vision boards and write down your goals. It¿s easy to stand in front of a mirror and declare affirmations.

And that¿s where most people stop.

The very act of dreaming stops you from achieving your dreams.

You¿ve played-it out in your mind with such intoxicating detail that you become satisfied enough. You become numbed. And you deceive yourself into believing you¿ve actually done something productive.

Consequently, when you attempt the activity itself, you immediately hit a stone wall of resistance. More often than not, you quickly distract yourself from the discomfort with some form of momentary pleasure. Yet, Robert Greene explains in his book, Mastery, that you can learn to love this internal resistance. In his words, ¿You find a kind of perverse pleasure in moving past the pain this might bring.¿
