Running is no different. I feel like each run should be better than the last. I’m addicted to striving for improvement, feeling fast and getting faster. I’m a data-obsessed runner with a high tech GPS watch strapped on tight at all times. It’s easy to record each mile split and weigh it against to previous runs or a typical easy run pace. I glance at the watch every minute. I get stressed when the pace doesn’t correspond with how I feel.

Under the influence of my GPS success, and quality of my runs hinges on a number and affects my self-worth: I feel like if I didn’t run fast I failed.

But what I love about running, especially trail running, isn’t about a number on a watch. It’s about movement in the mountains and appreciating what our bodies can do. Looking down to check pace is the bane of my enjoyment of the sport. So I turned off the pace function on my watch. Four months later I’m running happier, freer and faster.



trails have helped her to find an escape from the pressure of running on the road and the track. Setlack explained, “For years I’d been so focused on times. The trail became a way for me to focus on the basics of running. I had trained so hard for the World Championships and was disappointed in my result. When I was deciding what my first race would be after the championships, I was hesitant to get on the road again.”

Setlack decided to run the Canadian Mountain Running Championships as her first race post-worlds. She won. “The Mountain Running Championships were a perfect change in stimulus,” she says. “It was wonderful to just focus on running like a kid, from point A to point B. It was great to keep running pure and simple.”

Here’s Setlack’s advice for the novice trail runner. “Leave your Garmin at home. Enjoy your run and have fun. Leave time out of the picture.” Her advice for a long running career? “You have to listen to your body, make it fun, let go of expectations, and remember you’re lucky. We’re all lucky to be able to run. There are so many people who aren’t able to do what we do.”



Most people have days they’ll never forget. For me, that day is April 26, 2011.

It was my first time appearing on National Public Radio. As part of the program All Things Considered, host Michele Norris interviewed me about my research that suggested increasing narcissism in pop music lyrics. Michele was curious, insightful, and put me at ease. When I left my office and walked to my car, I felt light as a feather floating across campus, free of care and worry. I had no idea that what would happen over the next 24 hours would upend everything in my life. That day would take me down a different path—one that included regularly running 100-mile footraces.

This is the story of how I use the science of self-control to run ultramarathons. I believe that self-control is our greatest human strength, and the easiest thing that we can improve upon. By mastering the three components of self-control, you too could run 100 miles—or conquer other, seemingly unreachable professional and personal goals.

But before I marinate you in data, let’s return to that Tuesday night in April.

Why run 100 miles?

I never planned on running 100-mile races. I didn’t even know people did that sort of thing. 




I’m sitting here in my tent, the night before the 2017 Massanutten Mountain Trails 100, a horribly rocky 103.7 mile race in the mountains of central Virginia (my feet hurt just writing this). Right now, the sky is clear and bright, the air is fresh, and the camp is still and quiet. As I try to get some last-minute sleep before the 4 a.m. start of what will be my fifth 100-mile race in 3 years, I’m staring at the sky, thinking back about how I got started running these super long trail races, and why, to me, this is running.

I spent eight years trying to fit in as a road runner. I ran 5Ks, 10Ks, half marathons, and marathons. I aimed for a Boston qualifying time, (and missed). I joined running groups. Eventually I just realized that I wasn’t getting the high from it that I wanted—that I had been reading about. I didn’t care for the regimented training programs, the crowded expos, the corrals filled with people, or the elitism of many Boston Qualifiers, who often treat slower runners dismissively. What I love about running is the experience of feeling free and having adventures. All that other stuff was just bringing me down.

Apparently more than just a few crazy people were signing up for races that require you to run through the woods for an entire day in hopes of getting—of all things—a belt buckle. And they skipped all the things that turned me away from road races: there were no roaring crowds, no big fancy expo trying to sell you extra socks you don’t need, and a looseness to the whole thing: Every race is “x-ish miles” They feel less like huge events and more like just a couple hundred people with the same bad idea. I absolutely love them.

I have run trail ultras almost exclusively for the last two years. I’m starting to figure out that it’s precisely because these races feel so under-the-radar and irreverent that I choose to keep doing them instead of road races. When I sign up for a race, I know exactly what kind of experience I’m getting: adventure.

 And the conversations continue through the entire race. You’re sharing in the misery with each person you pass, or who passes you. It’s worth it taking the time to thank aid station volunteers for coming out to the middle of nowhere to serve grilled cheese to probably the worst-smelling group of people on earth.

There’s a casualness to the trail ultra scene that doesn’t exist on the road. I’ve been on the receiving end of more than one death stare after trying to strike up a conversation with someone looking to qualify for Boston in a marathon.

There’s a lot more equality in trail ultras, too. The guy taking 36 hours to finish a 100-miler is just as tough, if not tougher, than the winner. But to me, these races feel less like a competition against other runners than they are against the distance itself.



I don’t run mountains to go fast. I do it to explore, travel on new trails and spend time


There was lots of climbing, and sections of terrain technical enough that you had to stay completely focused. Trail running forces you to be in the moment. It’s mentally tiring, but also makes me feel totally present and Zen-like.



When I went into my first ultra, I had little to no information about what I was doing. No nutrition knowledge, no pacing knowledge, not even any idea how far 31 miles really was. I entered a 50K a week after a lackluster showing in the 3,000-meter steeplechase at the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials, and I was going to get revenge by crushing my first ultra. Well, turns out my race was about 24 miles and then a 7-mile slog after a magnificent bonk I’d never experienced before. Not sure what I was thinking, considering I’d been training for a 3K on the track for years.

It was still a great experience though; beautiful scenery, fun people, sunshine and dirt, but it gave me a new challenge and a goal to work toward in the years to come. Yeah, it took me years to figure out how to race the ultra distance. And I’m still learning new things with each one I compete in.



the racing is great, because i can test my limits, but it's not the most important thing, it's the experience, it's the running to the top of a mountain, and seeing something you otherwise wouldn't see




It takes time. Maybe it doesn't happen to everyone. But for me, it happened when I stopped caring about time, pace, mileage, even elevation. I was just out on the trails because it was fun and it was an adventure.


When you leave pavement behind and opt instead for the trails your body enters a new running arena, one of heightened awareness, varied muscle use and an incomparable way of connecting with yourself and your surroundings.

Below are some of my trail running takeaways:

In longer distance running events, the items offered at fuel stations vary and when you’re running for hours on end you have to consume a lot of calories. As someone used to short distance races and minimal fuel, it was fun to have a bit more excitement in this area during the race. At one aide station a doctor encouraged us to drink cold Pepsi and at different points during the race, I had pockets filled with energy gummies, handfuls of peanuts, strawberry filled cookies and granola bars. Since the inconsistent terrain is tough on muscles, cramping is a constant fear. I relied heavily on salt tabs before and during the race and was happy to avoid experiencing any debilitating cramps during the experience.



Run a section over and over again: This will help you figure out how to find your ‘line’ when running. I spent hours upon hours at the beginning running a small 200-yard section of a very technical part of the trail over and over again. I truly believe this helped my brain, eye, and motor sensory functions figure out how to look 15 feet in front of me and memorize where I needed to step. When you first start trail running you are going find yourself looking straight down, but this is actually incorrect. You should always looking ahead, so remind yourself to look 15 feet in front. Just slow down and try to memorize your line. It’s actually amazing now typing this as it’s second nature to me now. Today, I’m never looking right down. I’m constantly looking 15ft in front of me sighting where I’ll be stepping…even at a good clip.




Technically, an ultramarathon is anything longer than 26.219 miles, but they tend to range from a 50K (31 miles) to races that take multiple days to complete. 

They're a great opportunity to challenge yourself in beautiful territory with an aggressively friendly community," said Ian Seabury, who has run about 20 ultramarathons. "The courses are big and tough enough that you'll always have a substantial personal challenge in front of you, but the community is small and personal."
Ultras are about endurance over speed, about fun and challenge, rather than pace and finish times. Psychologically, it's a different head space as well, the mantra being that, barring injury, you just keep going, no matter what.

Though the races' popularity is starting to rival that of marathons, most ultramarathoners are too laid-back to see it as a competition.
"Marathoners are Type A; ultras are Type B," explained Seabury. The difference is largely due to the lack of emphasis on timing over finishing. And that creates a personality difference too, with ultras tending to be more supportive and less competitive.
As another runner put it, if someone fell on the course, a marathoner would jump over them, but an ultrarunner would stop to help. Helping another runner on an ultramarathon can actually be a medical necessity, as it could be 10 miles to the next aid station.

Running up and down mountains means greater physical demand than simply a long race. Elevation affects breathing, weather can add impediments and even danger, and the terrain of the trail -- rocks, tree roots, inclines -- threatens twisted ankles and falls along some steep ledges. In addition, there is the challenge of running by the light of a headlamp, all night long.
There are, of course, mental highs as well: the beauty of a trail run. Being social with other runners. Or being happily alone with your thoughts for hours and hours







The key is to understand that though running on trails is technically running, it's entirely different than running on roads. Similar to road cycling and mountain biking, running on trails is skill-based and requires a level of strength, balance, and focus that is greater than running on a smooth road.

Both are challenging, but one demands your attention on every stride. For example, when on a road run, most runners can look over at a buddy and wink while telling her about the movie they watched last night—even while adjusting their ponytails. If you try this on a trail, you'll end up seeing eye-to-eye with a bullfrog waist-deep in a pond and wondering how it happened so quickly.

But that's the joy of trail running—you have to run in the moment and focus on the next step, every step.


Running trails, especially technical singletrack trails, takes a lot more energy, strength, and balance than running roads, so it's wise to start out on a groomed trail before you jump foot first into leaping over obstacles. If you start out with the challenging stuff before you're ready, you will fatigue, your form will break down, and the risk for an injury increases.

While you're on the groomed trails, begin to run by effort or how you feel rather than pace, as your pace will likely be slower due to the demands of the trail. This will give you a better sense of how long your runs will take you at various efforts. Keep your trail runs at an easy-to-moderate effort while you're at it to allow your body to adapt more readily.

One of the greatest things about trail running is that every step is unique. You might have your right foot land on a slight angle one stride and then hop over a root the next. Because of this, it's wise to develop a solid base of body strength and balance before you run more technical trails. This will prevent ankle injuries and give you a greater sense of ease and power as you learn how fun it is to navigate what nature throws at you. Single leg exercises like squats, lunges, and standing balances are a great way to do so, as are other strengthening ex




When I first started trail running, I was set on the idea that no matter the grade or the terrain, I had to run every step, even if that meant barely moving up the hill, reduced to the most pathetic semblance of a jog. Little by little, I learned how to work the trail, where to push, where to hold back, where to run and quicken my step or where to hike, hands on knees for the most efficacy. Running the challenging route up Fern Canyon, one of my favorite trails in Boulder, Colo., taught me adaptability and to utilize my strengths more judiciously according to the terrain. It was the beginning of a shift in my perception in how to move most efficiently in the mountains.


Watch your step!
Carry water!
Trail running community is so much more relaxed than the road racing community- it's about enjoying the run, being safe while challenging yourself, and supporting each other. Time hardly seems to matter, and at the finish line/recovery area everyone just kicks back and is super friendly. It was such an overwhelmingly chill and happy environment, and soon into the race i let go of my 'time' expectations and just let go and had fun. ended up running exactly what I'd hoped to anyways, and did so without the nagging panic/watch checking of a road race.


Trail running is like a 7 course meal.  Road running is like eating a huge steak.

When trails are steep, breathing becomes harder, legs fatigue more quickly, and you tend to feel every painstaking step. A few mental and physical cues can help the hills feel less mighty and more manageable:

Stand Tall: Folding over at the hips and dropping your head to look at your feet compresses the air flow from your diaphragm and lungs to your nose and mouth. Try to maintain as flat a back as possible by staying in an upright position.

Quick Feet: Shortening your stride and taking quick steps help maintain efficiency on climbs. Short strides also help keep you in a more upright position.

Drive Those Arms: Power and momentum comes from a strong arm swing, so pump away to help propel your lower body.

Walk: There is no shame in walking up a steep trail. Walking, in fact, is sometimes the faster and more efficient way to get up a hill.


“Running on trails gets me away from thinking about anything,” says Collick. “You have to watch each step, each hill, each rock and root. You can run fast and not think about anything other than where you’re placing your next footstep.”


Try a Trail

Running circles around a track or atop unforgiving, steaming-hot roads is a great way to ensure you'll be miserable. The key to running (and life?) is to focus on the present moment. The next breath. The next step. Not the daunting thought of seven more laps or 2.5 more miles. Trails can help. With uneven footing, obstacles, twists, turns, and ascents and descents, no two steps, laps, or miles are the same. The tricky footing means your focus is completely absorbed in the moment, and without a long road to look down or a track to count your laps, you won't be able to psych yourself out as easily.
