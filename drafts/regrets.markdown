Look, no matter what you do, we all suffer in life. But there’s a difference in suffering, as Jim Rohn once said:


“We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret or disappointment.”


Achieving your goals. Improving yourself and your relationships. Writing a book. Building a business. It’s painful. It takes a lot of time, energy, and sacrifice to achieve things that are worthwhile in life.

But you know what’s also painful? The regret of inaction, disappointment, and laziness.

Which type of suffering hurts more? It’s up to you to decide.


Jack Canfield once said, øEverything you want is on the other side of fear.ø





We’re very accustomed to worrying, and it’s such a conditioned pattern that there’s no single antidote. The mind just jumps into scenarios and visions. Worrying achieves nothing but stress.

Many people waste their whole life completely preoccupied with everything that is out of their control, stressing on what disempowers, and overlooking everything that empowers them.

Corrie ten Boom says,“Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow, it empties today of its strength.”



Make a commitment to take charge of everything within your control and be intentional about not worrying about the things you can’t.

You can’t control everything that happens to you, but you CAN control the way you respond. And in your response is your greatest power.

Don’t get consumed with what others think of you because you can’t control that. Don’t stress over future decisions, because you can’t control them today.

Life is short. Don’t devote your your limited time to things around you that are going to upset, distress and exhaust you.




How many hours in the last week did you spend pursuing your dream? The only thing that counts is doing.
Now, be honest, how much time have you invested in doing this week?

How many hours have you invested in you this week?

I think we both know the answer.

Not enough. I get it. Work is grueling. Family time is demanding. Youøre burnt out. Exhausted.

Used up.

I get it. I do.

But realize something: We all have exactly the same amount of time in the day. Thatøs never going to change. So stop waiting for Daylights Savings Time or whatever magical event you think will occur. Start using the limited time you have more effectively.

Letøs address the common rebuttal here. øIf only I had more time.ø

Put that line of reasoning out of your head right now. Accept the fact that even if you had more time, it would simply fill up with more of lifeøs mandatory tasks. That is unavoidable.

The question is not one of how much time you have, but rather, how you use the limited time available to you.
This is what differentiates the truly successful from everybody else.

They Invest in Themselves.

Highly successful people spend hours every week investing in themselves. Learning, growing, and expanding on their current skill sets and knowledge.

Why do such a thing when time is already so limited?

Because successful people recognize that you are your most valuable asset. Every investment you make in yourself will pay dividends until the day you die.

There is no better investment you can make than in yourself.
So letøs get started.

Three Investments to Make in Yourself Today

Education

Rule number one: Never stop learning.
Youøre out of school, sure, but that was just the warm-up. Now itøs time to buckle down and get serious.

Invest 30 minutes every day to learning.
In one year youøll have put in 180+ hours of learning.

Health

Itøs easy to take this one for granted, but without your health, you literally have nothing. This becomes more and more self-evident as you get older.

Donøt wait for sickness or injury or lethargy to sidetrack you. Be proactive.

Invest 30 a minutes a day towards your health.

Exercise. It doesnøt have to be much, but it has be more than nothing.

Prioritize this. Your body is a magical tool, but only if you keep it tuned Exercise is just one aspect of good general health. The others are eating and sleeping.

I wonøt lie. Taking care of yourself isnøt easy. It is difficult and requires daily attention. This is why most people fail in the long run at tending to their health.






"The only things I regret, and the only things Iøll ever regret are things I didnøt do. In the end, thatøs what we mourn. The paths we didnøt take."




Older people see the mistakes they made when they were younger and what they would have done differently. No one wants to watch people live their lives and then regret their choices later on.




Doubt and fear are always near, especially when you are on the right track.

And it takes practice to embrace this realityø

Instead of a stoplight, I now see doubt and fear as a spotlight ø illuminating where I should go next. I realize all of the good decisions (and necessary growth decisions) that change our lives often cause us to lose a little sleep, and thatøs perfectly OK.

Fear has its place. Fear is helpful when it tells us not to walk alone in a desolate, poorly-lit parking lot at night. Or when it reminds us not to drive after a few too many. Fear is a helpful companion when it keeps us from danger that could prematurely end our life. But fear is not helpful when it keeps us from fully living.

The most important thing we can ever learn about fear is this: Fear is often a liar.

Itøs a liar because it is jealous. Fear is jealous of faith and courage and freedom. They get the best of fear every time. They take you to amazing places, create legacies, inspire people, and change lives. They are never lonely, meanwhile fear has this way of isolating you. And unlike fear, faith, courage and freedom grow when people call them by their name.



Those who know us will remember us through our acts of kindness, our sense of humour, that we made time for our relationships and friendships, that we showed up when it was important, that we helped others, the memories we created together, and how our presence made them feel - the reflection of a successful life.

What isn't remembered or talked about is how much money we made, how big our house was, what car we drove, how successful we were in our career, or anything else acquired through money, status and power, and yet many of us spend a disproportionate amount of our time and effort trying to "succeed" at these things.

If our definition of success is measured by how much money, status and power we have, this is what we will teach future generations about living a successful life. By putting a greater emphasis on coming first, or having more than others, they learn to make that the goal and believe that once they achieve it they will be happy. This conditional happiness is fleeting because happiness is dependent on the outcome of an event and once the event passes, we need another event to experience this feeling.

Real joy and happiness, the kind that cannot be shaken by anything, and is not dependent on an outcome, comes from the same place for each one of us, regardless of how much material wealth we have - it comes from giving and receiving love, helping others, being kind, and being present in our relationships. Having money, status and power won't make the birth of your child more joyful, or the death of a loved one less painful. What do you want each of them to say about you? What words do you want them to use when describing you? As they talk about your life and achievements, which milestones will they remember? What will be the source of their pride and joy of you? What will they have learnt from you? What memories will they share, and what emotions will these memories evoke in each of them? How will they say your presence made them feel?



My biggest fear is to live a life I regret.

It’s easy to fall into the trap Proust is talking about and spend life blindly chasing something you never actually wanted.

If we don’t pause and ask ourselves what we want to want, we will spend our lives focused on unhealthy aims defined for us by others and the worst parts of ourselves. We will pass these bad assumptions about life onto our children and loved ones. We will reinforce these boring, desperate defaults in everyone we encounter.

To achieve freedom we must be able to think for ourselves. If we don’t cut to the core and reprogram our wants (our desires) then our best-case scenario is to be the most successful, rich, or famous slave. If we never peer into our programming then we may end up the cleverest rat, but that’s hardly worth celebrating.

Asking yourself what you want to want can help you avoid wanting the wrong things.



2. They wish they hadnøt worked so hard

Working hard is a great way to impact the world, to learn, to grow, to feel accomplished, and sometimes even to find happiness, but it becomes a problem when you do so at the expense of the people closest to you. Ironically, we often work hard to make money for the people we care about without realizing that they value our company more than money.

The key is to find a balance between doing what you love and being with the people you love. Otherwise youøll look back one day and wish youød focused more on the latter.

4. They wish they had stayed in touch with their friends

When you get caught up in your weekly routine, itøs easy to lose sight of how important people are to you, especially those you have to make time for. Relationships with old friends are among the first things to fall off the table when weøre busy. This is unfortunate because spending time with friends is a major stress buster. Close friends bring you energy, fresh perspectives, and a sense of belonging, in a way that no one else can.





Write unafraid. Do not be tempted by the comfort of mediocrity. Yeah, you’re going to fuck it up sometimes. (Though mind that unlike with a steak or with a stew, the book can be revised and rewritten.) Yes, your efforts to do something that is uniquely you and totally untested will sometimes lead to a narrative car crash. That is as it should be. I’d rather you drive me, the reader, at top speed into a wall then slowly sputter down a quiet street at 25MPH.

Your best authorial self is always one about to ruin the story.

That sounds bad, but I don’t think that it is.

Take the risks.

Get ready to mess it all up.

Leap toward foolishness the way a stunt pilot plunges the plane toward the ground.

Always be leaning toward failure. Get ready to fall. Tell stories that are bold and strange. Make moves that feel dangerous and uncertain. Confidently assert your own chaos as you discard fucks over your shoulder like a cruel child plucking the legs from a captive centipede.

I want you to go for it.

Whatever it is you’re afraid of, go for it.

Whatever fears you have, step over them.

Whatever twists you can take, take them.

Sometimes this thing we do, it’s an act of closing your eyes and falling backward and hoping that the story reaches out with the hands of the audience and it catches you. And sometimes, that won’t happen. Sometimes you’ll crack your head like an egg on the pavement. But fuck it, fall anyway. Trust yourself. Enjoy the plunge.



There are moments when I wish I could roll back the clock and take all the sadness away.  But I also know that if I somehow could roll it back, all the joy I’ve experienced would be gone as well.  And the reality is, I can’t change the past anyway.  No one can.  The past must be accepted.  When you accept the past, regardless of how painful, you allow yourself to grow and heal.  For example, if someone breaks your heart, it’s not easy to deal with.  But you can heal, as long as you’re willing to accept the circumstances and then gradually let them go.  You may catch yourself thinking, “Why did I ever love him?  I should never have given him my heart!”  But that’s not a helpful thought.  If you didn’t love him, your heartbreak never would have happened.  But you did love him.  That’s reality.  And accepting that reality, and everything that followed, is part of letting it go and growing from it.  You don’t get to choose what is true.  You only get to choose what you do about it.



 when was the last time you did something that scared you




The most common regrets you have probably read about are: missed opportunities, not spending time more prudently, accomplishing more, not doing meaningful work, procrastinating, not forming better habits, not mastering another language or skill, getting into bad relationships, or making mistakes in a past relationship.

Regrets suck. But today, right now, you can do something about your choices to limit your regrets in future.

If you had a month to live: how would you spend it?
You could spend quality time with the people you love most, really paying attention to every word they said. You could go out and have some amazing experiences, explore the world. Or you could spend it learning as much as you can, in books and by studying life itself.

You could create something. Make a dent. You could leave a legacy by creating art, making people’s lives better, or solving a global problem in your own small way.

There is never a perfect time for you to take action. There is never a perfect time for you to launch that project, to spend time with your family, to write a book, change your habit, or embrace a new habit. Once you acknowledge this, you will get a lot more meaningful work done everyday.

I’m too tired. I don’t have the time. I am not capable. Someone else will do it. It’s too late now. Now is not the right time. I am not talented. I am not ready. I’m too scared. Nobody will help me. What if I fail. I don’t feel motivated. I’d rather do nothing. I don’t have the money..yet!

It’s easy to come up with excuses and justify not getting started. The longer you fill your head with rationalizations and empty excuses, the less time you have to take action.

It’s easy to say, “I will start when I have more experience, money, time and resources”. By this time next year, you will have a lot more excuses. It’s a cycle. And once you get caught in the loop, it, can be difficult to break free and do something meaningful you care about.

The self-criticism and self-doubt will always be present, and the only solution is to just act in spite of them.



Jim Walmsley:

øAt some point everybody's got to walk away, and say, øLook, I put out my best effort for the time, and maybe I could have done things better or differently and they would have played out differently. But I put a good foot forward and I'm happy with what I did,øø Walmsley says. øA little moment on the top is better than no moment at the top.ø



What advice would you give to anyone considering an ultra-distance race?
Be open minded. Donøt go into a race with limits. I donøt think anyone knows what theyøre capable of, so go push yourself and go find out. Sometimes you get in over your head, but thatøs totally OK. You canøt be afraid to do that. You really find out the best things about yourself when you find yourself in a deep hole.




From a financial, social, and/or professional point of view, what is the best age to start having kids?

Thirty. Thereøs a reason that 30 is the default child-bearing age for your standard non-Mormon. Thereøs a lot of shit that has to get done before you go and willfully end your social life like that. You gotta get through school, and settle into a job, and get married (or find a longtime partner if youøre one of those annoying people who despises marriage on principle), and watch your friends start having babies, and be married long enough that thereøs no longer much to talk about. Oh, and you gotta DRINK. You gotta drink and smoke all the pot and fuck all you can, so that you can have finally the kid and say to yourself, øOkay, I definitely did not miss out on any fun shit.ø By 30, youøre likely to have covered a lot of that.

Thirty is also young enough so that you will still be ambulatory after the kids have grown. You can be an active grandparent, and go to dinner parties, and take boner pills and have a good time. You donøt wanna still be raising small kids when youøre fucking 50. Mick Jagger is having another kid. Heøll be dead by the time that kid reaches kindergarten (at which point Keith will assume partial custody). Itøs nonsensical.


6. Too much thinking never solves anything. Only doing does. And thinking every once in a while about what you’re currently doing, what you might have done wrong and what you could do to improve what you’re doing might also help.

Look. You can think about things for years and years and years. But if you never do anything, then you’ll still be stuck at the exact same spot you’ve already been a few years ago.


7. 5) I wish I hadnít let myself become so trapped around money.

Finally, the money issue ñ this comes up in almost every conversation I have with mid-career professionals. Their fears around money, or their slavery to it, generate deep regret. People share that they know theyíre not living the life they long to, and theyíre sick and depressed about it, but they simply canít see a way out because theyíre trapped about money.

Either they feel they need to keep making exactly the same amount as they are today, so they wonít change directions or leave their toxic jobs or careers, or theyíre desperate because theyíre not making enough, so they want to pursue something ìsafeî that they know will make them miserable in the end.

Iíve learned that our relationship with money goes very deep, and stems directly from our wealth programming and what we learned from childhood about it. The negative, fear-based stories we tell ourselves about money keep playing out in our lives, despite all our best efforts. If we donít get to the bottom of our own money story, and heal it, we remain trapped in unhappy, desperate situations for the entirety of our lives.

If youíre like me, when you hit 50, it was a huge awakening. I felt as if I were suddenly in a new ìclubî and that club allowed me to be stronger, braver, and bolder, and stop wasting time. Suddenly, seeing that the number of years you have ahead of you in life is smaller than whatís behind you, is a very motivating experience. For many, it elicits an urgency to address whatís wrong in our lives ñ what makes us sick, sad, depressed and angry. It catalyzes us to muster the courage, fortitude and commitment to finally do whatís required to start living the lives we long to. And for that, we need to brave up.

6. 3) I wish I hadnít let my fears stop me from making change.

We have many different fears that stop us from taking action, but the biggest fears are around failure, loss, and pain. Mid-career professionals share with me that they have so much fear and resistance around making change, particularly if it means they have to stretch out of their comfort zone, speak up and stand up for themselves. They fear failing, going broke, not being able to care for their families financially. They fear leaving their ìcomfort zoneî yet they see that perpetuating the status quo is excruciating and damaging.

The fears mid-career professionals have, particularly women, often emerge from a lack of healthy boundaries, from intense people-pleasing behavior and a drive toward ìperfectionistic overfunctioningî ñ doing more than is necessary, healthy or appropriate. Until we can get in the cage with our fears and address them head on, fear will keep us stuck in quiet desperation.

5. 2) I wish I hadnít worked so hard and missed out on so much.

So many men and women in middle age share that they regret what theyíve missed out on in life, by working so hard. They missed being in the fabric of their childrenís lives. Or they missed the chance to have children. They missed the opportunity to build true intimacy and closeness with their spouses, family and friends. They missed experiencing adventure, travel, enjoyment, vitality, learning, spiritual growth ñ not having the chance to stop and relish life, nature, good health, peace, or relaxation. They missed so much and sacrificed so much to pursue work goals that now feel meaningless and empty.

Iíve seen that too that when people get to the end of their lives ñ in their 80s and 90s ó theyíre not thinking at all about the work goals they strived so hard to achieve. Theyíre thinking about love and family, about the people that matter deeply to them, and how they made a difference to these people. And they deeply regret what they didnít do with and for these loved ones.


4. Focusing only on making money.

"No one has ever been on their deathbed wishing they made an extra $100k. The biggest regret people have at the end of their life was waiting too long to go after their 'bucket list' experiences, not spending enough time with family and friends, or not making a difference in the world," narrated Sweeney. "Do something great now, even if it costs you money. The world is full of people who say 'I wish I could do that' or 'Someday I'll get to...' Most of them are so focused on their bank balance, or so afraid of what might happen they never do it and then get old telling their grandchildren not to make the same mistake they made. Don't be one of them."



ibecause guilt over indulgences is short lived, while feelings of  missing out arise gradually

recover from bad experiences quicker than we assume, due to our ability to reframe and rationalize how we see things. but it's harder to use these tricks to get over something never having tried something in the first place.

he only caveat I see with not living up to your potential is the feeling of regret. I never want to fail due to a lack of effort, and that‚Äôs exactly what I did when I didn‚Äôt try out for high school football. I can fail because I‚Äôm too stupid, the competition is too good or there was some uncontrollable, exogenous variable that negatively affected my chances. But when I know I‚Äôm not doing everything possible to succeed, then regret inevitably creeps in. You don‚Äôt want to go through life wondering what could have been if you had tried just a little bit harder.

I realized that all regrets were things that people DID NOT do, rather than things they DID. They did not follow their dreams out of fear of failure or worry of judgements. And it‚Äôs only near the end of the journey that they realized they should have done all those things when they had the chance to, and before it was too late to do so.

And the only person with no regrets was someone who did what he wanted over and over again.

I didn‚Äôt ask Ralph if his companies succeeded or failed. It didn‚Äôt matter. What mattered is that he started them. And for that reason alone, he had no regrets.

If I were able to time travel and visit my twenty or thirty-year-old self, there are some things I would really like to teach me.  Since I can‚Äôt do that, hopefully you will benefit from some of the lessons I‚Äôve learned over the last 50 years.

50 doesn‚Äôt feel like 50.  It doesn‚Äôt feel like the age you imagined when you are in your 20‚Äôs or 30‚Äôs.  For the most part, it feels the way you feel right now.  But smarter and more confident.  You also have more time and resources to enjoy life.  So don‚Äôt fear it.  Look forward to it.
Experience life before you settle down.  Whatever it is you want to do or experience, do as much of it as you can before you have children.  Especially travel.  Live in a hovel and drive a beat-up Dodge Dart if you have to.  But go have some really great, amazing, mind-blowing experiences.
Money and stuff are not all that important.  Yes, you want enough to be comfortable and do the things you want to do.  But accumulating for the sake of accumulating is so boring and empty.  Feed the soul, not the ego.

You will remember the fun, not the clean house or yard.  Make time for fun. 

‚ÄúThis is your life, and it‚Äôs ending one minute at a time.‚Äù

First, you have to know, not fear, know that someday you are going to die. Until you know that, you have no sense of urgency. You think you have all the time in the world to do amazing things, but you may not live to see that particular someday.

Many readers of this blog started their journey with debt, and had to learn to save. My journey was the opposite. I had to learn to spend. The important part of ‚ÄúGet Rich Slowly‚Äù for me was always the ‚ÄúSlowly‚Äù. I used to think I was doing fine: I put money aside every month, I barely spent anything ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt even need to pay a rent. But I was miserable

We were piling up money, so we thought we were doing things right. But it was never enough. I started being obsessed with money. We could never save enough of it: I wanted to cut off more and more. Sometimes I‚Äôd go without eating just to spend less.

I‚Äôd forgotten that money is a means, not an end. I‚Äôd forgotten that the goal is to save up to have a good life, not to have more money.

In many cases you stay stuck in your old routines for no other reason than that they are familiar to you.  In other words, you‚Äôre afraid of change and the unknown.  You continually put your dreams and goals off until tomorrow, and you pass on great opportunities simply because they have the potential to lead you out of your comfort zone.

Volunteering for an Intimidating Project

Your company is looking for someone to head up a special project for the quarteróone that will require some extra hours, will involve regular presentations to the executive team, and, in general, will cause you a whole lot of stress over the next several weeks.

Looking at the situation in the present moment can take the decision one way: You donít want to take on the extra stress, you donít have the additional hours to commit to the project, and youíre not comfortable putting yourself out there in front of the C-suite yet.

But look at the decision in terms of the future: ìIf I look back on this in a few years, will I regret not taking the challenge?î Because if you do take the project, youíll likely gain skills, confidence, and visibility to upper management that could benefit you for the rest of your career. And so, that stress and extra workóespecially for only a couple monthsómay very well be worth it.



You start using excuses to justify your lack of backbone:  ‚ÄúSomeday when I have more money,‚Äù or ‚Äúwhen I‚Äôm older,‚Äù or the over-abused ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get to it as soon as I have more time.‚Äù  This is a vicious cycle that leads to a deeply unsatisfying life ‚Äì a way of thinking that eventually sends you to your grave with immense regret.  Regret that you didn‚Äôt follow your heart.  Regret that you always put everyone else‚Äôs needs before your own.  Regret that you didn‚Äôt do what you could have done when you had the chance.

The regret checkpoint question is a good way to ensure that down the road, you did what was right for you, personally and professionally. And it can definitely go both ways. Some people can look ahead and say, ìEven if I work 80-hour work weeks for two years, it will all be worth it to land a senior positionóand I wonít regret it at all.î


Others, however, may say, ìIf I work 80-hour work weeks for two years and miss out on important events and spending time with family and friends, Iíll always look back on that time with regret.î Either way, itís important to make that distinction now, before you find yourself two years and hundreds of late nights later.


But what really unstuck me was advice from my best friend, a man Iød known for almost 40 years. He said, øDonøt spend your life making up your mind.ø He knew what he was talking about. It was our last conversation, three days before he died of leukemia.


We worry needlessly. It's been said that a day of worry is more exhausting than a week of work. If you understand worry, you can recognize it as fear trickling through your mind and wearing you out. Worry doesn't solve any problems, of course. It robs you of your effectiveness without making anything better--and most of the time, the things you worry about never even come to pass. Stop worrying about what can go wrong and get excited about what can go right.


how to get over it:

1. what could have done better? try to learn something from the mistake
2. it couldn't have worse? look on the bright side
3. no use crying over it now? don't dwell on it
4. how can i fix that? take action

go easy on yourself, mistakes are a part of the journey

5 tips
1. live a life that is meaningful to you
2. have courage to express your feelings
3. prioritze family time over long hours at the office
4. stay in touch with friends



In every situation, you must ask yourself, øIs this the best possible use of my time?ø Is this the best approach? Or am I settling for less? Derek Sivers has created a great benchmark for activity: If something is not a HELL YES!, itøs a no. End of story. If you are not 100% behind what youøre currently doing, stop doing it. There are certainly better things you could be doing.

There are a million good things you could do this very moment. You could go to the gym. You could read a book. You could hangout with a friend. You could spend the evening with your family. You could watch a movie.

But what is the øbestø thing you could be doing right now? Context determines what is good, better, or best. Every situation is different.
