“You are brainwashed. Most people fall asleep on their careers and we fear you have fallen asleep on yours. To wait ten years for a possible promotion that may or may not happen, and keep your dreams in check all that time — that’s not your best path! How long have you worked for your institution already?”

“Twelve years,” said Anthony. “I got this job coming out of grad school, when I was twenty-seven.”

We urged Anthony to look outside his institute’s walls to the larger world, where all sorts of fascinating projects are brewing.

Many or most of us stay in a job too long because we get too comfortable. We put on blinders and focus on whatever path or ladder exists in our current organization, instead of looking at all the paths and ladders in other organizations and the ones we could build ourselves.

We start to believe that staying with our current employer is a very high career priority — maybe the highest one of all. That’s false! The only way to grow our muscles is to use them. You don’t learn anything new repeating the same job for another year.

There are no hard and fast answers to the question “What’s the ideal amount of time to spend in one job?” but it is hard to make the argument that you are still learning and growing after five years in one assignment.

Depending on the job description, you may have mastered the role and be ready for a new challenge in one year.


What about staying with one employer, only in several different roles?

You can do that and many people have done it, but you still won’t get the breadth of experience hanging around in one organization that you would accumulate moving to a new organization every few years.

Once a year on your anniversary date at any job, ask yourself these questions:

• How can I update my resume to showcase the wonderful things I’ve learned and accomplished in the past year? If you have no major accomplishments in a year, it’s time to think about leaving.

• If I were job-hunting right now, how would I answer the question “What did you learn each year that you worked at [my current employer]?”

• What do I want from my career, over the long term? How is this job moving me closer to my vision? If it’s not moving me closer, why do I owe this employer another year?

Change is good for us, but we resist it. We like to stay safe and cozy, forgetting that there is no safe spot or cozy corner anymore. We forget that the safer and cozier we feel, the stronger the urge to drowse off will become.

Once you go to sleep on your career, you are in danger. You are like a hibernating mouse in a burrow. Any weasel could sneak down the burrow entrance and eat you while you’re sleeping. Don’t fall asleep on your career — make your current job and your current employer work harder every year to justify your continued participation in their projects.



It is easy to lose track of the passage of time when your job feels secure. We can easily be lulled into a stupor. ThatÕs bad, because when you fall asleep on your career you lose touch with the outside world and the market for your talents.

Your skills can fall behind the market. Whether you work in a toxic workplace like AdrienneÕs or a wonderful workplace, falling asleep on your career still does damage to your marketability.
