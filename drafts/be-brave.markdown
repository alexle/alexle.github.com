Anyone who knows me knows I'm generally a conservative person. I don't enjoy gambling or taking huge risks.

I'm modest. I'm humble. I'm the guy that says he bombed the math test and ended up getting a 90%.




I don’t think I’m the most talented runner..






Accomplish an ‘impossible’ goal

Few things compare to the exhilaration of accomplishing something that you didn’t think you were capable of. These achievements fall so far outside of your comfort zone that they seem impossible. Maybe it’s running a marathon or giving a keynote speech at a convention. These accomplishments are worth every bit of suffering you endure to achieve them because once you finally do it, you feel invincible and carry that triumph with you forever.


Your results aren’t a reflection of your talent. Lots of people have talent. Few people, however, are required to rise to a difficult challenge.

Most people never put themselves in demanding situations — situations that humble and scare you.

You need to put yourself into positions that create immense pressure. The kind of pressure that will either make or break you. This is how you purge out your weakness and small-mindedness. It won’t be pretty. But it will change you. And eventually, you’ll rise up. New. Changed. Better.

You need to be taking on challenges that require you to become so much more than you currently are. You need to put your back against the wall so you have no other choice but to produce.

This is how you evolve.

How do you put yourself into these situations? You initiate. You don’t wait for life to come to you. You don’t wait for the “next” opportunity.



On the track today, give it your all and perform at your fullest. Do the same tomorrow with your next scheduled workout, and the next day, and the day after that. Live in the moment and be the best you can in that instant of time, each and every day.

you only get one shot in life and you should find out what's in your reserve tank. coasting is for pussies. it's when you dig deep that you feel the most alive

with fitness there's never a finish line. you can always do better. for me personally, i guess i probably have 30 to 40 years left on this earth. and how many of those am i going to be young and healthy enough to do things? i want to experience the best stuff i can






The choice is yours.

When something sucks, do you quit? Or do you push-through and eventually enjoy the satisfaction of growth and success?

Anything worth doing is going to suck at the beginning. Anything worth doing is meant to require pain and sacrifice. Herein lies the problem facing America, which originally was built on the moral of impulse control. What once used to be a country filled with people sacrificing momentary pleasure for a better future, the overpowering message of today is live for the moment.

And that’s exactly what people do. They live for this moment. Consequently, when something sucks, or becomes hard, most people quit. Most people indulge themselves in momentary satisfaction at the expense of a better future.

To make matters worse, the twin “truth” of today’s culture is love yourself for who you are. The self-esteem movement of the late 20th century is an enormous contributor to America’s faltering success.

People are taught to love themselves regardless of their performance. Thus, they justify mediocrity. Yet, Asian’s and other immigrant groups who often are considered to have low self-esteem consistently outperform American’s who have high self-esteem.

Unlike in other parts of the world where hard work is seen as a virtue, the repeated phrase in America is: “Don’t work too hard!” Success these days is to get as much as you can for as little work as possible.








chase after greatness, don't wait for itThere are no shortcuts to any place worth going.

Deep down you know this is true.

You have to do hard things to be happy in life.  The things most people are avoiding.  The things that frighten you and make you uncomfortable.  The things others can’t do for you.  The things that make you question how much longer you can hold on and push forward.

Why?

Because those are the things that ultimately define you.  Those are the things that make the difference between existing and living – between knowing the path and walking the path – between a life of mediocrity and a life filled with progress and fulfillment. there are no short cuts .. it is not the type of activity you can finesse your way to success .. to get better, you have to put in the work






all I am I put into this moment .. had the guts to go after something scary, something unknown .. wake up the next morning knowing you gave everything you could


zach miller:

.. a lot of us have a perception of what our limits are .. when i race i guess i try to throw those out the window

.. it's not that i don't have limits, it's just maybe that i perceive them differently

.. i think that's one of the most beautiful things about racing

.. if you can step to a race line or a circumstance in life 

.. and say i'm not afraid of the failure, i'm just gonna go for it

.. and i may not succeed, but i'm just willing to try. that's a really freeing and fun thing

.. i don't go to races guaranteeing myself anything

.. i don't even really go to races knowing what i'm capable of doing

.. i more just show up to races willing to try something i'm not sure i'm able to do

.. it's a been a mixed bag over the years, but i'll tell you one thing,  the days where you take the risk

.. and you get an outcome that you weren't sure was possible .. or an outcome and you stand on the other side of the finish line and just shake your head and say, i don't know how i just did that

.. then you go home and dream about the next wall you can get over

.. what's the next big thing you can do, that yesterday you thought was impossible



## Tempt Failure ##

Tempt failure.

March right up to it. Always write as if youÕre about to fall on your face. Add fire. Bring the char. Toss in a weird ingredient.

IÕm not saying anything particularly new here. The cliche, true enough as many cliches are, is no risk, no reward. Just the same, what often marks some of the greatest fiction Ñ or, put differently, some of your favorite fiction Ñ is a willingness on the part of the creator to take those risks, to march into the gloom of uncertainty into a place where every step might lead to a sucking mire or a starveling beastie. Some of the best work is done when itÕs done by an author who knows what theyÕre about to do is not precisely advisable, or entirely safe, and yet they say, fuck it, fuck this, fuck that shit, IÕm doing it anyway, motherfuckers. They broke a rule. They took a thing long past its expected arc. They blew up a trope or juked right when everyone else wouldÕve gone left. They tried something new, and it either pays off or it fails spectacularly. And honestly IÕd rather read something that fails spectacularly than something that just kind ofÉ putters along in the manner of an elderly dachshund


## Questions To Ask ##
The next time you confront a situation that scares you, ask yourself a few questions:

What is the worst thing that can happen? Often the worst-case scenario is someone saying "no" to our offer.
What's the best possible outcome? We rarely imagine success. So, really--what if the action you're considering worked out perfectly?
What will you learn? Taking action--regardless of the outcome--produces a lesson. The lesson is invaluable because it informs your next step. No matter what, you'll be smarter and more capable after trying.



We’ve all encountered opportunities that both delighted and filled us with fear. Fear of doing something new, something unknown, something outside of our comfort zone. And as with anything worthwhile in life, oftentimes the things we fear end up being the most eye-opening and beneficial experiences. So how can we start to push ourselves? And what does it take to be the kind of person who succeeds despite their fears?



You will do this. Say it to yourself a thousand times. Remember that during the race, just like during the several months of training you have endured, your body will question your sanity and give you hundreds of reasons to quit. Prepare your mind to have an answer for every question your body asks. Never forget why you are doing this.


11. Do something everyday that terrifies you

But you don’t have to constantly be battling your fears. Actually, Darren Hardy has said that you can be a coward 99.9305556% of the time (to be exact). You only need to be courageous for 20 seconds at a time.

Twenty seconds of fear is all you need. If you courageously confront fear for 20 seconds every single day, before you know it, you’ll be in a different socio-economic and social situation.

Make that call.

Ask that question.

Pitch that idea.

Post that video.

Whatever it is you feel you want to do–do it. The anticipation of the event is far more painful than the event itself. So just do it and end the inner-conflict.

In most cases, your fears are unfounded. As Seth Godin has explained, our comfort zone and our safety zone are not the same thing. It is completely safe to make an uncomfortable phone call. You are not going to die. Don’t equate the two. Recognize that most things outside your comfort zone are completely safe.




Don’t manage your mood by procrastinating. Ask yourself what beliefs underlie your feelings and question those.

Are you afraid of the task? Why? Does it have a knife pointed at you? No. You’re afraid you’ll do a lousy job. Well, you’re gonna do an even worse job if you don’t get started.

Change your beliefs and you change your feelings. Change your feelings and you’ll get more done. If I point something at you and you believe it’s a gun, you’re scared. If you believe it’s a toy gun, you’re not. You’re not psychic or omniscient. It’s your beliefs that create your feelings, not reality.


Getting curious is a practical step you can use to productively manage your fears. Asking these questions on a regular basis, whenever you feel fear bubbling up, can help you get clear about the real risks--and the ones that are just in your head. Often, your fears are not truly physically or even professionally dangerous, they just feel that way. Getting to know them better allows you to deal with your emotions more rationally

## Run Hard ##

become a PR-seeker to continue earning that wonderful feeling of satisfaction you can only get from walking through the finish chute thinking, I ran absolutely as hard as I could. I faced the pain and the doubt and I did not back down one inch.



This is no time 2 complain or concede. This is YOUR moment, so don't let anything get in your way!"



Whether it’s money, love or just life in general, if you want rewards, you have to take risks.
When it comes to money, taking risks means investing in things that can go down in value, like stocks, real estate or your own business. Can you get through life without taking risks? Sure, but as my dad was fond of saying, you’ll never get a hit from the dugout.

Invest $200 a month at 2 percent for 30 years, and you’ll end up with a little less than $100,000. Earn 12 percent on the same investment, and you’ll end up with nearly $900,000. Taking a measured amount of risk is the difference between getting rich and getting by.

That being said, making risky bets is simply gambling. Take measured risks. Minimize risk by knowing as much as possible before investing, not putting all your eggs in one basket and learning from your mistakes. Or better yet, learn from someone else’s.



Runners always reach a limit to their tolerance for suffering before they hit the limit of their physical capacity. Hence the phenomenon of the “end spurt.” In studies where athletes are asked to exercise at a fixed intensity to complete exhaustion, they are able to complete a very short sprint at a much higher intensity immediately afterward. Why? Reserve capacity.


open my eyes to what is possible, to what i could be capable of





Exhilarated by the thrill of my first race, visions of a victorious finish danced before my eyes. But as I started the climb up Puke Hill, my confidence wavered. My pace sputtered and slowed. A girl in a maroon jersey staggered past me, struggling to maintain her pace. The inclined increased, and I slowed to a walk. I can’t do this, I thought.





Why it Works: “I know for sure this workout is a physical and psychological boost. It’s always hard, and there’s always a section where I think I can’t do it. Breaking through that wall in a workout builds a ton of confidence. It also helps for perspective…I do each of the intervals at a pace that is faster than what my PR for 800m used to be. It reminds me that I’ve come a long way!”




I ran the first mile in 6:17, the second in 6:18. The final mile was one of the most painful things I’ve ever experienced. My legs and lungs burned as I made my way up a long, slow climb. With 800 meters to go, I searched myself for any last push, and I crossed the line in 19:46.

That’s the PR I’m most proud of: It took more guts to fight the pain without letting up than it took to race any of my seven marathons.



Every runner has those key workouts from which they draw the most confidence; the ones that solidify in their minds that they are ready to execute on race day. These workouts not only provide important physical benefits, but perhaps even bigger mental ones. In the moments just prior to a race when we wonder, “Am I ready?” or  “Am I going to be able to do this?” we can look back at our training and answer confidently, “Yes!”


Confidence is key, but it’s a fickle beast. When you have one of ‘those’ workouts under your belt, however, they seem to quiet that voice of doubt.


Running hard is a very intense, heightened state of awareness. Time crawls, and it hurts. But there can be no doubt whatsoever, during those moments, that you’re alive.




It’s often said that being brave is not the absence of fear. Being brave is having fear but finding a way through it. You suggest that if a person’s goals and dreams don’t scare him they’re probably not big enough.




When you see things from multiple perspectives, you realize you can achieve almost anything you want in far less time than you imagined.

Yet, most people have fixed and limited views about themselves and what they can accomplish.

They have fixed and limited views about the resources available to them.

They have fixed and limited views about time, and how long things must take to accomplish.



I recently came across an interesting article

When I'm not outside running, I'm likely reading about running. One recent caught my attention across a recent article on competitor.com [Racers vs. Pacers][1].


i've never been good at taking risks

> Pacers tend to run with their heads and not their hearts. This allows them to pace effectively and run very consistent races. However, pacers often lack ambition and run too conservatively. This can lead to a lack of major breakthroughs when it comes to race times. A pacer is more afraid to fail than a racer. The pacer may run consistent times but might have PRs slower than someone with the same ability, but with a more ambitious racing strategy.


Skill 2: Realizing You Won’t Die

This sounds grim, but it’s not. Consider one of my favorite quotes from Arnold Schwarzenegger. He’s not a runner, but his ability to push himself in training and competition is legendary.

“Experiencing this pain in my muscles and aching and going on is my challenge. This area of pain divides a champion from someone who is not a champion. That’s what most people lack, having the guts to go on and just say they’ll go through the pain no matter what happens. I have no fear of fainting. I do squats until I fall over and pass out. So what? It’s not going to kill me. I wake up five minutes later and I’m OK. A lot of other athletes are afraid of this. So they don’t pass out. They don’t go on.”


I like the challenge both physically and mentally that comes with running. Plus it¿s free and can be done pretty much anywhere

Do you think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy putting yourself through this sort of pain? I think there’s magic in misery, and that’s been lost in western culture. We thought if we took all the pain and struggle out of our lives, we’d be happy, and I think we’re so comfortable, we’re miserable. When you’re struggling, when you look back at that experience, that’s when you feel most alive, and I think people seek that out because life is so mundane now.


Take risksÑcalculated and safe risks, of course. Take a leap of faith. Take a chance. Run an extra few miles. Go with a faster competitor in a race. Run a different distance.j

Sweet is never as sweet without the sour.


One day you won¿t be able to do this, today is not that day.

I think about how much I will regret it if I bail on a workout or give up halfway through. I was told by a friend that no-one can do it for you, and when it comes to race day, only you know whether you¿ve given your all in both training and during the race. I like to know I¿ve given everything I have, that way whatever the result, I can be proud of myself.


a lot of people run a race to see who's fastest .. i run to see who has the most guts .. steve prefontaine

"I may never have another chance to run down the finishing stretch in the Olympic marathon ever again. I'm going to run it as hard as I can!" Jared Ward

Run Bravely

ÒDonÕt be afraid to go out too hard,Ó McCandless says about JonesÕ philosophy. If youÕre in search of a big-race performance or a PR, it starts in practice. Practice running brave before the race.

ÒLearn to hurt in workouts,Ó Jones says, Òand youÕll be able to hurt more in races.Ó

In some workouts, JonesÕ instructions include six words: ÒHands on knees in the end.Ó Translation: This will be a really hard workout.

The idea of going out too hard in some workouts is in building yourself back up afterward and gaining the confidence to do the same in races. You canÕt do anything in a race you havenÕt practiced first, so itÕs important to play with fire in some workouts and know what it feels like to get burned. You might fall to pieces and barely finish the workout, or you might surprise yourself and destroy the limits you previously thought existed. YouÕll never know until you try, and Jones believes in testing your limits throughout the year.

Saving nothing for the way back, consuming yourself in a cause — choosing to be, as Jack London put it, ashes rather than dust — is of course not a sound policy in all things. In most things, really.

Success in modern life most often hinges on moderation, on budgeting one’s resources, carefully pacing the distance. Being sensible. Prudent.

And yet there are times when victory can only be achieved by he who goes all in, who spurns an exit plan, who has no option B, who leaves it all on the floor. In some things in life, there are simply no guarantees. You have to push forward with all you have and make the most of the moment. You have to trust that even if you burn up so much fuel on the way out that you don’t have sufficient energy for the way back, you’ll have yet traveled far enough to have reached another shore. You won’t have to return to where you started. You’ll have opened a new possibility for your life.

As Anton and Vincent swim through the ocean towards the horizon, the former, frightened by fatigue and how far out they’ve gotten, beseeches his brother: “We have to go back.”

“It’s too late,” Vincent answers. “We’re closer to the other side.” To which his brother replies:

“You wanna know how I did it? This is how I did it Anton.

I never saved anything for the swim back.”
