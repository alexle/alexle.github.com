Deciding to start a fmaily brings a lot of excitement .. and a lot of questions. Is the timing right? will everything work as it's supposed to? will the baby be healthy?

Every time I would run a hard workout, I would think to myself: am i harming my chances of getting pregnant by doing this? Is 25 mpw ok? 50mpw?

in order to get pregnant, your body has to believe that it's a good time for you to build a babhy .. that you are in a relatively safe place with enough calories to support a pregnancy




Ever since publishing, The Fear Of Screwing Up Our Kids As FIRE Parents, I’ve been brainstorming how we can give our kids everything without giving them everything. The worst thing we can do as parents is take away our children’s sense of accomplishment. I pity the kid who starts off driving a BMW to school instead of walking or biking.



1) Having dinner together matters

Kids who have dinner with their families do better across pretty much every conceivable metric.

A recent wave of research shows that children who eat dinner with their families are less likely to drink, smoke, do drugs, get pregnant, commit suicide, and develop eating disorders. Additional research found that children who enjoy family meals have larger vocabularies, better manners, healthier diets, and higher self-esteem. The most comprehensive survey done on this topic, a University of Michigan report that examined how American children spent their time between 1981 and 1997, discovered that the amount of time children spent eating meals at home was the single biggest predictor of better academic achievement and fewer behavioral problems. Mealtime was more influential than time spent in school, studying, attending religious services, or playing sports.
Doesn’t work for your family’s schedule? It doesn’t have to be dinner. And it doesn’t have to be every night.


2) Share the family history

Children who know the stories of those who came before them have higher self-esteem and a sense of control over their lives.

Marshall and Robyn asked those questions of four dozen families in the summer of 2001, and also taped several of their dinner table conversations. They then compared the children’s results to a battery of psychological tests and reached some overwhelming conclusions. The more children knew about their family’s history, the stronger their sense of control over their lives, the higher their self-esteem, and the more successfully they believed their families functioned.
I’ve posted many times about the power of story. Having a family narrative is great for children.

“The most healthful narrative,” Marshall continued, “…It’s called the oscillating family narrative. ‘Dear, let me tell you, we’ve had ups and downs in our family. We built a family business. Your grandfather was a pillar of the community. Your mother was on the board of the hospital. But we also had setbacks. You had an uncle who was once arrested. We had a house burn down. Your father lost a job. But no matter what happened, we always stuck together as a family.’ ”

Marshall says that children who have the most balance and self-confidence in their lives do so because of what he and Robyn call a strong “intergenerational self.” They know they belong to something bigger than themselves.

6) Empower the children

Down with parental dictatorship! Kids do better when they make plans themselves or at least have a say.


You should even allow them to pick their own punishments. It creates greater motivation to obey the rules.

Scientists at the University of California and elsewhere found that kids who plan their own time, set weekly goals, and evaluate their own work build up their prefrontal cortex and other parts of the brain that help them exert greater cognitive control over their lives. These so-called executive skills aid children with self-discipline, avoiding distractions, and weighing the pros and cons of their choices.

By picking their own punishments, children become more internally driven to avoid them. By choosing their own rewards, children become more intrinsically motivated to achieve them. Let your kids take a greater role in raising themselves.
