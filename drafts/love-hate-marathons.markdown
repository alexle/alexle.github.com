My Love/Hate Relationship With Running A Marathon
04-15-15


Know what's difficult? Real stuff. Risking everything to start your own small business; providing for a family every day for 30 years; caring for your kids while caring for your aging folks and not being sure whether you have enough love, energy and resources to cover everyone.

Know what's difficult? Watching a loved one struggle with illness; losing a great and special friend.

Compared with all that, a marathon is 26.2 glasses of chilled champagne. Compared to life, a marathon is a big, marvelous chili dog.

Marathon running isn't for everyone. But athletes who feel up to the task and training gain more than bragging rights.

Preparing to run 26.2 miles takes three- to four-months of training, a significant time commitment that alters your schedule, workout regimen, sleeping and eating habits. Such preparations also require sacrifice and support from your loved ones.

"It's not like people do marathons because they're fun," said Ellen Brenner, co-owner of Fleet Feet Sports Rochester and Yellow Jacket Racing, which owns and operates the Rochester Marathon in New York. Marathoners want to test themselves and achieve a goal, she said. To do so, they train diligently.

"Running a marathon is one of those epic milestones," said Mort Nace, general manager of Medved Running and Walking Outfitters in Pittsford. "The distance is a challenge, especially that second half. What it takes goes well beyond being physically prepared."

2. Building confidence - When you finish running a marathon, you get that sense of satisfaction, that sense of accomplishment," said Kiplangat Tisia, 26, a professional runner who lives and trains in Rochester, N.Y. "You feel like anything you try, you can now achieve."

3. You'll test yourself - Jason McElwain, 26, of Greece is among marathoners who loves the challenge of the distance. A cross-country runner in high school, McElwain said he needed a break from the sport. When McElwain started running again in 2011, he not only targeted 26.2 miles, but aimed to run fast enough to qualify to run The Boston Marathon. To date, he's run five marathons. Part of what McElwain said he loves about marathons is how the distance forces him to test his limits.  Your body wants to stop, but your mind can't let it, he said. "I just keep pushing," he said. "I don't think, I just go. I run the mile I'm in."

4. You'll gain more than you lose - "No matter how fast or slow you go, it's never easy and it always goes just a bit longer than anyone running it would like it to," said Chris Patterson, 30, of Rochester, N.Y. "I've gained a lot of humility and perseverance for completing the marathon distance." Patterson said that in his five years of marathons he likes helping other runners reach their time goals just as much, if not more than, achieving his own goals.

9. It will change you - "You become a better version of yourself," Nace said. "Having passed that test, having accomplished that goal and suffering through training, you may not run the race you want, but you are a stronger version of yourself as a result." Tisia agreed. "When you race, you compete against yourself and others, but mostly you're reaching for something. Nothing is given to you, you have to work for it and that experience builds you as a person."  Knowing you can complete such a feat is empowering and exhilarating. "If you can do this, what can't you do?" Nace asked.
