There are countless stories about how we ought to live our lives. We are expected to be ambitious; to want to be wealthy, successful and well educated; to get married, be monogamous and have kids. These social narratives can make our lives easier, by providing guidelines for behaviour, and they might sometimes make us happier, too. But they are, at their heart, stories – and ones that may not have originated with present-day people in mind. As such, many of these stories end up creating a kind of social dissonance whereby, perversely, they cause more harm than good.


You should really exercise four times per week. Not just jogging though, high-intensity interval training. And do intermittent fasting. And drink two gallons of water a day. Don’t forget to meditate.

If you’re not waking up at 4am, you’re missing the most productive hours of the day. Did you watch some television? You could have been using that time for reading books. Not just popular books and novels though. You should be reading classics from Seneca, Aurelius and Laozi.

Productivity guilt is this. It’s the constant nagging feeling that you should be doing more. And if you’re not doing everything, then you’re a lazy slacker who will never reach your goals.


Productivity is Good, Productivity Guilt is Bad
Trying to improve ourselves is a good thing. But too much guilt doesn’t help you do that. If you’ve been feeling a lot of guilt lately, here’s a few things you can do:

Pick a few goals to work on (maybe only one) and tell yourself it’s okay to not work on other things.
Stop comparing yourself to other people. Those people you admire also have flaws they don’t reveal. Work on improving yourself, not feeling guilty because you don’t see yourself reaching somebody elses standards.
Separate the nice-to-have from the essential. Most advice is nice-to-have—it helps, but only a little. If you can focus on the essential things that matter for your few goals, then you can stop feeling guilty about everything else.




uestion 4: Is this a priority in my life right now?
It’s crazy how many people set arbitrary New Year’s resolutions just because their friends and family are doing it.

Take traveling for example. On social media, you’ll see people posting photos of themselves in exotic locations, having these seemingly awesome experiences. People see these photos of their friends having a great time and say to themselves, “Man, I really should travel more!” So they make it their New Year’s resolution to do so.

As the months go on, they keep moving the day to travel down the road. They never really decide on a destination. And dang, wouldn’t you know it, they’re just so swamped with work right now, there’s no way they’ll be able to get away … and they never end up traveling!

In reality, they never really wanted to travel in the first place. And guess what? That’s totally fine. If traveling isn’t really important to you, you shouldn’t do it.

Here at IWT, we believe in going all in on the parts of life that really matter to you — while mercilessly cutting out everything else.

Don’t really care about traveling? Don’t do it.
Getting a six pack isn’t important to you? Don’t bother with that gym membership then.
Is learning a new language a priority for you now? If not, don’t set aside time to learn.
Focus on the things that truly matter to you — and forget the rest.







Indeed, data released this week from Allianz Life shows that more than half of millennials (57%, versus just 28% of Gen Xers and 7% of boomers) say they’ve spent money they hadn’t planned to because of something they saw on social media.

This is partly because millennials say they feel pressure to keep up with their friends’ spending — and of those, nearly half say that social media posts of friends’ vacations and lifestyles contribute to that pressure, according to 2017 data from TD Ameritrade. Social media also makes 61% of millennials (versus just 35% of Gen Xers and 12% of boomers) feel inadequate about their own life and what they have, with 88% comparing themselves to others on social media (compared to just 71% of Gen Xers and 54% of boomers who say the same), according to the Allianz data. This in turn, can spur spending.

“Social media has become the millennials’ financial Achilles Heel,” the Allianz survey, which questioned more than 3,000 adults ages 20-70, concluded. Adds Paul Kelash, vice president of Consumer Insights for Allianz Life: “More than any other generation, social media and the allure to spend beyond their means could have long-term negative effects on [millennials’] finances if they’re not careful.”

This likely exacerbates the already tough financial spot many millenials are in: “Millennials (ages 18 to 34) are more likely than other generations to have nothing saved,” according to a 2017 survey from GoBankingRates.com — with nearly half of young millennials (18-24) having $0 in savings. And most haven’t saved appropriately for retirement either.

Not only can social media wreak havoc on our finances, it can also hurt our mental health. Younger adults who use social media a lot are at a higher risk of depression, and people who use many different social media sites are at higher risk for anxiety and depression. What’s more, the more time people spend on social media, the more likely it is they feel socially isolated — with people who spend more than two hours swiping through social media sites nearly doubling their risk of feeling socially isolated.



FOMO is a compulsive desire to experience something (or be somewhere) motivated not by what you gain, but rather by the fear of what you will potentially lose.

It's the irrational belief that the next place/person/event is going to be the perfect one and you're missing out by focusing on wherever you are or whatever you're doing. It's hanging out with nine different friends each week and not feeling close to any of them. It's going to five different bars on a Friday night and hating every single one because you can't stop thinking about the next one down the street your friend is at and is probably way cooler than wherever you are.

FOMO is becoming a big issue with our generation for the simple fact that our generation has the most options and choices to choose from. This has been famously called "The Paradox of Choice" and it's pretty much why the more amazing things get, the less happy we all become .

If you have two breakfast burritos to choose from, you'll pick whichever looks better and not think anything of it.

But if you are offered 37 different varieties of gourmet, artisanal breakfast burritos with locally sourced goat milk ganache, then you're likely to torture yourself, and not just making the decision itself, but you'll wonder for the next five hours if that was the best burrito you could have had in that situation or any situation ever and then decide that you have to go back to try the other ones. Except this is the fourteenth brunch cafe you've said you have to go back to and not only are not even hungry anymore, but you don't even like burritos and OMG THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH TIME TO DO ALL OF THE AMAZING THINGS.




The problem with FOMO is that it prevents you from actually experiencing what's happening . That might sound crazy, since FOMO is often what drives people to try to accumulate as many experiences as possible, but it simultaneously robs those same experiences of any significance or lasting meaning.


So they don't actually want to go to dinner with their co-workers. But then they think that this might be the big moment where everyone has that epic night together and bonds with one another and loves each other like besties forever and ever. So they go anyway. And because they don't actually want to be there, they don't have an epic night, and they don't bond, and nobody becomes their bestie, and instead, they sit there on their phone imagining all of the other cool amazing things they could be doing instead of this lame dinner with their co-workers.

In this sick and twisted way, the FOMO person crams their life full of activities while not actually being present or appreciative of what's happening . In their desperate obsession with quality experience, they compensate by accumulating quantity of experience.

And that's really what FOMO boils down to: objectification. Not just of others, but ourselves. Treating our lives as some sort of itemized checklist or score to be maxed out before we die. But life is not a video game . There's no report card waiting for you at the pearly gates. And no, you can't take your Facebook timeline with you when you're dead.


The way to get out of feeling FOMO is to start killing those fantasies that you're letting rule your decision making.
There's no such thing as a perfect beach. There's no such thing as a perfect partner . There's no such thing as a perfect night out or a perfect party or a perfect group of friends .


Better and worse are highly relative things. And they depend on far more than what looks good on paper ( or on a smartphone ). You can go to the most perfect place in the world, but if your dog died the day before you left, it's going to be a horrible trip. There's nothing you can do about that. So much of what makes life "good" or "bad" is unpredictable and outside our control.

Eventually what stopped my FOMO was realizing that you are always missing out on something. Yes, I was running away on these amazing trips to see amazing places. But I was also giving up the stability and community that comes with building a home. I was giving up making strong connections with people, and being there in a reliable way for those I cared about. I was giving up my ability to focus for long stretches at a time, to build something more out of my career and my skill-set and to reach my full potential.

Some of these other valuable-yet-unsexy experiences — being alone, maintaining friendships, educating yourself — you will never see them on Instagram because you can't take a picture of them. It's not something out there outside of yourself. It's something you build upon within. And the first step to that building process is the day you realize that life isn't about accumulating more experiences, but rather focusing extremely well on less .





Facebook also worked with Carnegie Mellon University for additional insight, and found that “people who sent or received more messages, comments and timeline posts reported improvements in social support, depression and loneliness.” Likewise, Facebook said students at Cornell who used Facebook for 5 minutes while viewing their own profiles saw “boosts in self-affirmation,” while folks who looked at other profiles did not.








 “It’s so easy to make fast plans, and if something ‘better’ comes up it’s so easy to cancel,” another woman, Stacey, told me. Others echoed her sentiment, adding that—thanks to social media—FOMO (that’s Fear of Missing Out) is often at play: We say yes to everything because we don’t want to miss anything, and because we want to continue to be asked.
 


“People are just making decisions, not because it’s a good investment, but because they’re getting emotionally pulled into saying, ‘Oh no! I’m going to miss out! What if other people are in the market and I’m not in the housing market?’” Shen told Farnoosh Torabi on an episode of her “So Money” podcast.

Shen said that working in engineering taught her to focus on math rather than emotion when it came to her money.

“It’s separation from the FOMO, which is based on feelings rather than fact, and then stepping up and doing the math and realizing, ‘Wait, I don’t want to do what everyone else is doing. Maybe they’re not right. Just because everyone is doing it, it doesn’t mean it’s correct.’”



Be Wary Of Social Media
As if our own pressures weren’t enough, we have our expectations totally warped by what we see on social media. “I see a lot of people have unrealistic expectations as a result of social media (Instagram in particular),” Dr. Erika Martinez, licensed psychologist, says. “They’re looking at the best 2% of curated content of other’s lives and comparing it to 100% of their own. It’s an impossible feat and a recipe for disappointment. I’d say it’s better to have be on the lookout for the small moments of connection and intimacy in your own life, than spend time comparing your relationship to other people. After all, what you see is never the full picture.” Remember that those relationships you see on Facebook or Instagram don’t look like that all the time. If you compare yourself to them, you’ll just make yourself miserable. We can all put a photo portraying a certain type of relationship on Instagram, but that doesn’t make it real.




A lot of our thinking about money revolves around the gains: I’ll invest x to get returns of y percent in the long term; I’ll buy this couch because it will brighten up my apartment and make me happier. But when it comes to financial decisions, it’s also important to consider what you’ll be giving up.

Because we’re human, we make impulsive decisions all the time. But rather than rushing decisions or simply going through the motions, really thinking about what we’re giving up when we make these decisions is a way to take a long-term view of our finances rather than a myopic one.





There’s a great Chinese saying that I hope you guys follow, “If the direction is correct, sooner or later you will get there.”




When I was in my early twenties I was lucky enough to spend about a year living just a few blocks from the beach in Virginia Beach, Virginia, but you know what I remember most distinctly from that time? Sitting at a red light on the way to work one day thinking: I feel trapped.

To put it simply, I felt stuck in a life I didn’t want.

I had a college degree I wasn’t using. I had a job that I dreaded. I had no idea where I was going or what I was doing, and I certainly had no idea how to get to the next thing, whatever that was.

Looking back, though, while all of that was going on, I was refining and honing what it was I truly wanted and who I truly was.

I read a zillion self-help and career books. I took a life coach training program. I started meditating.




Why do my friends all seem to have more money than I do?

vacations and drive more expensive cars than mine. How am I really doing compared with others my age?

It happens every morning, from Wichita to Washington: We wake up feeling good. We pick up our phones and scroll through Instagram.

We guess at the carat weight of a college friend’s engagement ring and marvel at a cousin’s shiny new truck. We’re lifted into tornadoes of jealousy over photos of a friend’s puppy. We puzzle over how they afford it.

But this social media highlight reel leaves a lot out.




Fear of missing out, or FOMO for short, refers to the persistent worry that others are having rewarding experiences for which we are not included. The origin of the acronym is credited to Patrick McGinnis who used it in his Harbus article Social Theory at HBS: McGinnis’ Two FOs. In our world of constant accessibility of information — through social media and other channels — we are seemingly bombarded with prospection that others are having more fun than we are. The reality, however, is that there are practical restrictions preventing any of us from doing it all. To think otherwise is folly.

Despite this reality, we still want to fool ourselves into believing we live in a world of infinitely obtainable options. If only you are let in on “the secret” the world is full of abundance for the taking. We are hijacking the beauty of situational intimacy for the cheap thrill of vicarious displacement. The desire to be continuously connected with others and see what they are doing is a feature of FOMO. A report by J. Walter Thompson (JWT) showed that Millennials are the most affected by this phenomenon (JWT, 2011). However, Generation Y is feared to be affected at increasing rates, too. With the help of social media, FOMO is pervasive and has the ability to negatively impact us all.






It seems like I’m falling behind my friends financially. They take nicer vacations and drive more expensive cars than mine. How am I really doing compared with others my age?

Unrealistic Expectations

This is a big one. Too often, a person can let what they see others doing with their lives dictate how they feel about their own. This is dangerous because if you get nothing from this article, please understand that rarely anything is as it seems. People flaunt all the time on social media so if you are comparing your relationship to what others say about theirs through pictures, posts, and videos you are doing yourself a disservice.

Attention Robber

Another one that people need to realize; social media can suck the life out of your relationship when you or your partner constantly use it. In the car, on the train, at work, on a date, in bed; it doesn’t stop. This can affect intimacy for sure and when the romance wanes, that’s a whole other set of problems to deal with.




Your “successful” peers aren’t that successful.
I know it seems like everyone graduated college and is making six figures and vacationing in Paris, but they’re not.

That gold watch you see them wearing, you can buy at Macy’s for like $40.

All their new outfits are passed down from older friends. Their vacations to Hawaii, their dad hooked it up. In general, this is usually how it goes. Don’t worry, they’re all just as lost as you are.

Nobody has any idea what they want to do in life.
Building on #6, everyone seems super together. Everyone seems to have a plan. Everyone seems to know exactly where they’re going.

Sit down with that person for a one on one dinner, and they’ll probably reveal to you their long list of fears and anxieties.

Don’t worry. It’s a 20-something thing.







FOMO stands for Fear Of Missing Out. The term is usually reserved for those who spend everything they have to buy the latest thing or experience without any regard for their financial future. FOMO is what drives people to go into revolving credit card debt, making credit card hawkers rich, and their slaves poor. FOMO is the main reason why people are unhappy, even if they are living better than 99% of the world.

Those who refuse to save for retirement justify their spending by saying, “you can’t take it with you.” It’s true. No matter how much gold you bury in your grave, your spirit takes nothing physical with it.



Not giving into FOMO can help a lot. After all, leasing a new car, renting an expensive apartment or dropping half of your paycheck on clothes and vacations might help you keep up with your friends, but it’s also a quick way to keep you from that $1 million goal.


Buy a luxury car after you hit $1 million, not before.
Instead, figure out what you value the most and avoid wasting money on everything else. “I have an expensive watch that I love,” Sabatier said. “That being said, my clothing budget for the year is $300 because that’s not where I want to spend my money.” The average person spends about $1,800 on clothing each year, so you probably have a lot of wiggle room: Here’s how to save money on everything you buy.



Missing Out
02-12-2012


Social media is different. It has become a kind of self esteem narcotic. People thrive on how many “likes” they get. They stage the best photos and curate the glamorous moments of their lives. It has become the new “keeping up with the Joneses.”

What you seldom see are the routine parts of people’s lives. The boring stuff like reading email at work. Poring over spreadsheets and enduring conference calls. Doing the laundry and vacuuming. How boring!
People only portray the cool stuff. The coffee shop photos or selfies in the gym, where they’re showing up their sedentary friends. They share this stuff because it reflects well on them. They know it will garner lots of likes. And that makes them feel good.

The question we should ask ourselves is this: What’s the point to all of this? Are we really so unfulfilled and shallow that we have to construct a fairy tale life on social media?

Social media has become a place for distortions, where our real selves remain backstage. We photograph, photoshop, curate and upload the best we got. Then we hold our breath and pray for some attention.
There’s a name for this mindless appetite for attention and validation. It’s called “digital narcissism.”





This got me thinking:

There’s a curious cultural phenomenon of documenting every moment of our lives. We photograph every happy hour, haircut, outfit, bruise, cute cat pose and funny license plate.

But how often do we look at those photos?

Almost never.

We’re so bad at reviewing old photos that app developers built Timehop to remind us to glance at our memories. Heck — we’re so bad at reviewing photos that the most popular social media app, Snapchat, is based on the premise that we’ll never view these images again.

But why? Why do we ignore these photos?

Maybe this reflects a simple truth: The more items we own, the less we value them.

Digital photos are abundant, so we rarely look at them. But the solitary black-and-white snapshot of your grandmother in 1940 is framed and displayed.




You will miss a ton, but thatâs OK. Weâre so caught up in trying to do everything, experience all the essential things, not miss out on anything important â¦ that we forget the simple fact that we cannot experience everything. That physical reality dictates weâll miss most things. We canât read all the good books, watch all the good films, go to all the best cities in the world, try all the best restaurants, meet all the great people. But the secret is: life is better when we donât try to do everything. Learn to enjoy the slice of life you experience, and life turns out to be wonderful.


A few years ago, I was doing nothing with my life. I was sitting around watching all these really incredible people doing really inspiring things, while I was sitting around on my butt, wishing I could be like them. They seemed in a whole different world than me.


Trying to keep up with all of your reading sources, online networks, etc., which have an endless stream of posts.
Trying to catch up with a reading backlog that might have items that are months or even a year old.
Being afraid that youre missing important or key articles or posts.
Not being sure that youre reading all the best blogs and sites, or following th

Trying to keep up is not only impossible, but a great waste of your life. You could be spending some of that time creating, pursuing a dream, exercising, learning a new skill, spending time with a loved one, or taking a nap. Any of those would be better than trying to keep up with everything, or worrying about it.

What might you do instead? Try the drop of water flowing towards you at this moment, and enjoy it. It might not be the best drop of water in the river, but who is to say? Maybe it is. Maybe if you love that drop fully, it will be the best, regardless of how good other drops are.

Every day, youre not adding to a new list on a whiteboard  those youve read and those you still have to read  but instead youre starting on a clean whiteboard. This clean board is empty of what youve already done, but also empty of what you still need to accomplish. Its blank, which means the possibilities are endless, and the guilt is zero.

Then you can decide how to fill that slate each day, and enjoy whatever you choose to experience. Then let go, with a new slate each day.

The fear of missing out. ¿ If you feel anxious because you constantly feel like you¿re missing out on something happening somewhere else, you¿re not alone.  We all feel this way sometimes.  But let me assure you, you could run around trying to do everything, and travel around the world, and always stay connected, and work and party all night long without sleep, but you could never do it all.  You will always be missing something.  So let it go, and realize you have everything right now.  The best in life isn¿t somewhere else; it¿s right where you are, at this moment.  Celebrate the perhaps not altogether insignificant fact that you are alive right now.  This moment, and who you are, is absolutely perfect.  Take a deep breath, smile, and notice how lovely it is.  

What stops so many of us from making a commitment is our fear that once we make a choice we have to close the door on all the other options. If we marry Andy, we will never date Charles. True. If we become an architect, we will never be a ferret trainer. Also true. However, if we do sack up and choose to become an architect, then we have a whole host of new and shiny choices to think about! Should we make a doghouse or a people house? Should the house be blue or red? Should the building be small, medium, or big?

Choosing doesnÕt limit choicesÑit just changes them. So feel free to pick that city, that career, that partner, knowing that even commitment brings a whole new set of options Ð children/pets/red and blue houses Ð to be excited (and angsty) about.

But here’s the bare truth: we will miss out, no matter what. It’s inevitable. We cannot do or try everything in the world, even with lives twice as long. We cannot see every town and city, read every interesting book, watch every important film. We will always, always miss out.

Here’s the second, more important truth: if you always worry about what you’re missing out on, you will miss out on what you already have.
So for now, I’m making the most of my current season, hanging out with my kids as much as possible during this precious and fleeting time in their development, and learning to enjoy the small and simple things right at home. Once they quit pooping in their pants, I look forward to starting a new season where we travel and camp as a family.

Even if you love skiing, there’s no sense in pining for it in the middle of July, and you’re better off concentrating on what you can only do during the season you’re currently in (swimming! wake boarding!). In the same way, even if there’s something from a previous season in your life that you once enjoyed but doesn’t fit into it right now, instead of spending your time worried about what you’re missing out on, make the most of the uniqueness of your current season.
