Here’s all I know about Blogging:
No one has time to read your article, write the first lines like they’re a TLDR.
The design of your site is irrelevant.
To start out you don’t need any software.
Define your audience.
Figure out where your audience is.
For SEO don’t write short articles (>2000 words)
One well researched article is better than a lot of mediocre content
Spend half of the time writing, half promoting.
Spend 50% of the writing time actually writing, the rest tweaking, reading and illustrating. Details are important.
Spill all your secrets. Don’t be worried about the fact that you’ll run out of content, you won’t.
There are no rules, slowly craft your unique style.
Go back in your old posts and link them to newer ones.
Start a Newsletter.
Do what everyone else is afraid to do.
Reach out to people asking for things or offering tips.




When most people think about developing a writing habit, they imagine having to spend countless hours in a quiet room isolated from the rest of the world. This keeps them from trying to develop a writing habit at all. But you can accomplish remarkable things in just one focused hour a day of uninterrupted creation time.

We overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do in a year. An hour a day doesn’t sound like a lot of time when we look at it in isolation. But when you add it up throughout the year, it’s the equivalent of 15 full days. Just imagine what would happen if you committed 15 full days to one project or idea. You would make a lot of progress.

In writing for a just one hour a day, I come up with ideas for blog posts, sections for the books I’m writing, and reflect on the key insights I’ve gained from conversations with guests on The Unmistakable Creative podcast. Writing for one hour every day produces an exponential ROI and an infinite value that can’t be measured. Writing for one hour a day can improve the quality of both your personal and professional life.

Because habits are the compound interest of self-improvement, you may not notice any significant changes in the first week, month, or several months of writing. 

If you write for an hour a day, you’ll have a reason to get up in the morning and have something to look forward to. As a result, you’ll be happier and more fulfilled. Once you’ve developed the habit of writing every day, it’s something that you’ll likely do for the rest of your life. You’ll become the author of your life story because words are the building blocks of all creation. With the power of words, we shape our reality and become the architects of our destiny. Of all my habits, hobbies, and rituals, nothing has done more to improve the quality of my personal and professional life than writing for an hour each day. As Dani Shapiro wrote in her book Still Writing “I believe you can learn everything you need to know about life from an ongoing attempt to write.”








“This is why”, “can we guess”, “only X in” and “the reason is” were also incredibly popular three-word combinations in headlines.

Emotions make people click and engage. That’s why emotional headlines are so powerful.

Among the most popular phrases: “make you cry”, “melt your heart”, “give you goosebumps”, and “can’t stop laughing”.

Better headlines make people curious.

Which explains why phrases like “this is why” and “the reason is” attracted tons of engagement on Facebook.

Quizzes. BuzzFeed is known for publishing quizzes like “Can We Guess Your Age and Location With This Food Test?”

As Rayson noted in the research: “These quizzes appeal to our desire to know more about ourselves and to prove we’re smart, we did grow up in the 80s, we are living in the right city, or whatever it might be. These quizzes are like mirrors, it’s hard to walk past with out looking at yourself. They are hard to ignore.”

Tribal headlines work. And this headline trend is growing, according to BuzzSumo.

Basically, a tribal headline includes the words “that only”. For example, “17 Slightly Terrible Things Only People Named Sarah Understand” or “14 Things Only People Who Adore Print Books Will Understand”.

“Control of your” was the least engaging headline. So you’ll want to avoid this three-word phrase.

Others word combinations that failed to generate engagement: “your own business”, “work for you”, “the introduction of” and “what new in”.

“X reasons why.” For example, 26 Reasons Why ‘Personal Brand’ is NOT a Dirty Phrase.

Other engaging headline combinations: “X things you”, “This is what”, “This is the”, and “This is how”.

The most popular phrase at the end of a headline is “the world”. As in, “Why South Korea has the highest concentration of robots in the world.”

Some of other words you’ll see at the end of the most engaging headlines: “X years”, “goes viral”, “to know”, and “X days”.

Literally.

The word “this” is the most popular first word used in headlines. Now you know.





One of the ladders I often use, is this one, starting from top (beginning) to bottom (end):

TOP RUNG: Identify a common gripe or problem you have, that the reader is likely to share.
FOURTH RUNG: Discuss how this involves pain or comedy, discomfort, and it sucks or is plain ludicrous. Make the problem felt by the reader and make them see that you also felt that pain at some point and that you are a lot like them.
THIRD RUNG: If there is an opportunity for it, talk about how others have tried to fix this problem and have found that it didn’t work (emphasise that you are the best solver to this issue out there).
SECOND RUNG: Introduce your solution — your take on it — how it has helped you personally. This can be something that helps soothe the problem or obliterates it entirely.
BOTTOM RUNG: Give them an idea on something tangible and doable they can do right away to start solving that problem. An action step they can use today.





5. The humility to cut what wastes the reader’s time.

I had someone reach out to me recently who described my writing style as “minimalistic.”

I’d never thought about it that way—but that’s an accurate word for it.

Some writers love description. They want you to see every blade of grass, every leaf on the tree, every long and winding grain in the tree trunk turned kitchen table. Other writers love dialogue. They want you to hear their characters talk, and talk, as if their voices were lined with gold and a pleasure to listen to indefinitely. Some writers live by the facts, and color their paragraphs with statistics and footnotes and miscellaneous information intended to add further depth to the topic at hand. And some writers just want to float on their stream of consciousness, letting their words guide the way without ever intervening and making a conscious decision to stop and move on to the next point or moment in time.

To each their own, but from my experience (and I’ve written close to 2,000 pieces online), readers in the digital world have only so much patience.

They just want you to get to the point—Netflix shows do this addictingly well.

Part of writing in the digital age means understanding your audience—and today’s readers barely have the patience to sit through a two-sentence tweet or a seven-second Snapchat video.

Paragraphs and paragraphs of static description is a lot to ask of today’s readers, and a good many writers fail because they refuse to adjust.



The ball rocketed into the air, took a definite left turn, and crashed down into the water with a sickening:

*Splash*

My dad and I were on the 11th hole, and I was practicing for an upcoming golf tournament. The day’s work wasn’t exactly going well.

“UGH! I suck!”
I slammed my club into the ground and dad grabbed me by the arm.

“If you say that again, we’re walking off the course.”

“But dad, I DO suck! Didn’t you see that?”

He glanced over at the remaining ripples.

“Yep, I sure did. That shot sucked. But you don’t.”
I used to think actions spoke louder than words, but to tell you the truth, I now think it’s a pretty even split.

Words have enormous power —

the power to make or ruin someone’s day,
the power to encourage or embarrass,
the power to inspire or crush.
Words broadcast the person within. An insecure man will tear others down with his words. A fulfilled woman will make others strong.



The Trifecta
The pros, the writers we all admire, manage to do all three at once.

Great writing is alchemy — you take bits of entertainment, mix in some education, and add a dash of inspiration, in order to create remarkable work.

Writers are like chefs. We all have the same ingredients available to us. The ones who set themselves apart master the mixture of these ingredients.



Use simpler words.

There are many words for you choose from. Shorter, simpler, smarter.
Example: Replace “however” with “but”, “utilize” with “use”.

Use synonyms.

Lost for words? Use tools like Thesaurus or Grammarly to find synonyms.
Avoid passive voice.

Passive voice and passive-sounding verbs sound boring and indirect. It’s always stronger to use active voice.
Example: (AV) “Your boss asked you to work overtime.” vs. (PV) “You are asked to work overtime by your boss.”

Use “you” and “I”.

Often we overuse the pronouns “we” and “us” to be relatable. While they show your empathy, “you” directs the message straight to your readers.
Also, sprinkling in some “I”s makes you more genuine with your readers.
Delete the “-ing”.

In most times, the “-ing” adds no value to your sentence.
Example: “The ‘-ing’ adds no value.” vs. “Adding the ‘-ing’ has no value.”

For your long term benefit, you should keep a list of new words and amazing expressions for future use.



Golden rule: Delete the word “that”.

An excessive amount of “that”s is annoying to read. We tend to think THAT the more connective words we use, the easier it is to read.

Read it without “that”, it sounds stronger.
Less is more.

(See what I did there?)
The best copywriting follows this rule: use 2 or 3 words in a sentence. Nike’s “Just Do It”, McDonald’s “I’m Lovin’ It”, Avis’ “We Try Harder” are all essence of their own brand and images.
Also, avoid hedges, disclaimers, and tag questions to keep your sentences shorter. They make you sound less persuasive and convincing.
Example: “An afternoon nap boosts your productivity.” vs. “I think an afternoon nap could possibly boost your productivity, don’t you think so?”

Label your readers with nouns.

“I dream a lot”
“I’m a dreamer”

In fact, these two sentences convey the same message. The latter generates a longer-lasting attitude on your reader’s minds, because the noun is central to your reader’s identity rather than a simple action.


Paragraphs are equally important.
Again, less is more.

Keep your paragraphs to 2 or 3 sentences long, or even a single sentence long.


Organization is key.
Overwriting is common problem. And you need to be willing to cut unnecessary details from your article. People cling onto what they’ve written because they don’t want to abandon their creations. But the real lesson is to learn to delete extra information.
Biased writing is also a huge “no”. Even when you are writing with a stance, often include several drawbacks (a.k.a. a two-sided argument) makes you more convincing and rational, so your readers are more willing and comfortable to join your side.



Successful writing gets your point across to your reader
This, above all else, is probably the most important lesson I’ve learned about writing. It seems obvious, but it was actually a revelation for me. You see, for years I had assumed that writing was all about me — how I wanted to come across, how I wanted to express my voice, how I could leave my unique and personal mark on the world

Write for your reader. Know what you want to say and what you hope they take away. In those precious moments that they have given to you and your words, write so they might learn or feel something. Write so that it’s easy for them to remember your message in the days and weeks to come.

There is no shortcut to better writing, just as there is no shortcut to better design, or any other craft. You must simply do, and then it gets easier. The thing that has helped me the most is setting writing goals based on volume. In my first year of blogging, my goal was to post something every week. It could be short or long, good or shitty, but I just had to hit the “publish” button once every Tuesday. I realized that if I goaled on quality — “I should only publish posts that I feel are great” — then what ended up happening was that I’d rarely publish anything (because most of the stuff I wrote early on wasn’t great), which meant I became less and less motivated to write. Whereas the quantitive goals — 500 words a day, a blog post a week, a journal entry a month, a long post on Facebook every two weeks, etc. — were all about the doing, which meant they were achievable.




Weasel words are qualifiers. They can make your position seem weak or ambiguous, as though you’re trying to create a little wiggle room. Say what you mean! Slash words like: could, can, like, may, might, virtually, up to, as much as, believe, and possibly. You may need a qualifier every now and again, but more often than not you’ll find yourself able to cut them without changing the meaning of what you’ve written. In fact, your writing will be stronger and you’ll sound more confident


Toss out very, really, and other empty words

Renowned newspaper editor William Allen White said, “If you feel the urge of ‘very’ coming on, just write the word, ‘damn,’ in the place of ‘very.’ The editor will strike out the word, ‘damn,’ and you will have a good sentence.” Editors disdain the words very and really, so it only stands to reason that you should pitch them out when you’re cleaning up your draft.

You may find you have a tendency to use adverbs to amplify weak adjectives. Instead of saying that death metal concert was “really loud” you could say it was “ear-splitting.” That good-looking salesman may be “very cool,” but why not describe him as “suave” instead? Better yet, especially if you’re writing fiction, do your best to eliminate adjectives that tell readers how to feel. Invoke feelings through narrative, instead.

Just like very and really, there are plenty of other words and phrases in the English language that, more often than not, aren’t necessary in clean writing. When you find them hanging around in your drafts, just like the 150 neckties hanging in your closet (including the twelve you actually wear), strike them out whenever possible:

That
Currently
Presently
Actually
In order to
Start to
Suddenly
Because of
Therefore

Redundant words and phrases can easily creep into writing, too. Search your draft with an eye out for where you might be repeating yourself. Here’s an example:

Before: Not a soul wandered the dark, deserted streets that night.

The words “not a soul” imply that a place is deserted. “That night” implies darkness. Eliminate the redundancies:

After: Not a soul wandered the streets that night.

Also, keep an eye out for tautologies—phrases with words that mean or imply the same thing. A few examples:

Baby puppy
Future prospects
Added bonus
2:00 a.m. in the morning
Completely devoid
Final outcome
Duplicate copy
Honest truth
