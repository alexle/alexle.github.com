3. Take full ownership of the current state of your life.
Stop making excuses. Take responsibility.

I get it: Shitty things have happened to you. Life isnøt fairøsome people get the short end of the stick. But bemoaning this fact and adopting a resentful victim mentality wonøt help you at all; it will corrode you from within, like acid.

If you believe you are a victim and youøre destined to be perpetually shit on by reality, that belief will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. We often self-sabotage, procrastinate, and play the victim because weøre afraid of stepping into our true power. Believing you have the power to live a fulfilling life is the first step to doing so.





Never Blame People For Your Unhappiness
As a child, you’re taken care of by others. That may be your parents, siblings, family members, foster parents, or any other person who takes responsibility. Hence, you assume that someone is responsible for you.

But that’s not true. When you grow up, you are responsible for you. So never look at others when you’re unhappy—it’s not fair to the people in your life. Instead, accept your unhappiness, and then do something about it.




	Remember people's names. I hear people claiming that they have short memories and cannot possibly remember people's names all the time. Jim Kwik came up with a terrific hack to prove these folks wrong. He asks: "If I tell you: 'You will get one thousand dollars for remembering this guy's name,' would you remember it?" Sure as hell you would! So it's not about your brainpower, it's about the motivation. If you want to remember, you can remember. Ask people to repeat their names. If it's hard, ask them to spell it for you. Repeat after them. If you forget, ask someone else from the group, "Hey, what was the name of the guy in red shirt? I forgot." Do whatever you have to do to remember. And then call people by their names. People love that.


	Remember people's stories. The whole point of listening is to remember what people tell you. And it can be a great foundation to follow up (see idea #8), spark new conversations, or start/strengthen the casual friendship. Remember names of people's family members, pets, hobbies, details about the job, a side gig, what are they obsessed with, remember as much as you can. People are absolutely psyched when they realize that you actually listened to them and remembered their story. This is a surefire way to stand out because the majority of people only waits for their own turn to speak. Which reminds me...
 



 Give Up Your Excuses
øItøs not about the cards youøre dealt, but how you play the hand.ø  

ø Randy Pausch, The Last Lecture
Successful people know that they are responsible for their life, no matter their starting point, weaknesses, and past failures.

Realising that you are responsible for what happens next in your life is both frightening and exciting.

And when you do, that becomes the only way you can become successful, because excuses limit and prevent us from growing personally and professionally.

Own your life; no one else will.






Itís easy to make a choice when it seems as if there is no choice. When we believe that there is simply no way we can make something happen, itís very easy to just say, ìI canítî and be done with it.

ìI canít wake up that early.î
ìI donít have time to ______ after a full day of work.î
ìI canít afford to eat like that/dress like that/look like that.î
ìI donít have the luxury of free time to do ______ like you.î



Whatís hard, then, is to realize how and when weíre relinquishing control by saying ìI canítî and switch to saying, ìIím choosing not to,î which is the more accurate and honest answer. It stings, and itís hard to say, but itís true, and thatís all too often how the truth is.



I think everything would be much, much harder, honestly. Because when we accept responsibility, when we admit we have a choice, we come face to face with the possibility of having made a poor choice, a small but potent dose of what we perceive to be a possible failure, because the flip side of those statements is:

ìI choose to sleep later than that.î
ìThatís not how I want to spend my time after a full day of work.î
ìI am not willing to spend my money on those foods/clothes in order to look like that.î
ìI have not created any ëfree timeí to do that.î



And so we stick with things like ìI canít afford that,î ìI donít have time,î and ìI canít do it,î in order to protect ourselves. This works nicely when our circumstances are less than satisfactory, because we are able remove all blame from ourselves. However, in protecting ourselves from blame, we are also protecting ourselves from a deep sense of pride we could feel if our circumstances were magnificent. If things are wonderful, can we take responsibility for those circumstances, or do we relinquish control there, too?

You know what, though?
Itís all a choice, even if we donít admit it.


However, changing our thinking from ìI canítî to ìI can, Iím just not willing to,î changes so much. It changes how we spend our time and our money, how we invest our feelings, and it also changes how we see others.

Most importantly, what changes when we begin to choose our lives instead of letting our circumstances make choices for us, is ourselves.
We become intentional beings instead of a collection of circumstances perceived to be beyond our control. We begin to live on purpose, and though it may be harder, it is worthier. It may be a life with more opportunity for swinging and missing, but it is also a life with more opportunity for freedom and a joy that only comes from making choices.

Up to you.

You're Not Setting Realistic Goals
Latreal told POPSUGAR that biting off more than you can chew and taking on too much at once is the biggest recipe for failure. "In the world of weight loss, the biggest thing is people being real with themselves, and that's the hardest part. Most people set themselves up for failure [by setting unattainable goals]."

It's like the New Year's resolution effect. You make a big goal for an extended period of time and then don't have the tools to follow through. This is especially true if you have no prior experience! "For someone who eats like crap and doesn't work out, does all the wrong things . . . and all of a sudden one week you're gonna get up, work out, eat healthy, and do all these things that you don't do!" She said that this always ends up backfiring, leaving people frustrated and with no progress.

You Want Instant Gratification
If you've ever done an ab workout and wondered why you don't have a six-pack immediately after, you're not alone. "We're in this world of instant gratification, where everyone wants something overnight," she said.

Don't expect to lose weight faster than you put it on: "So you've gained 60 pounds over the past five years, but after a week of working out you think, 'I've been doing everything!' and get frustrated. I'll look at you and say, 'It's been a week. Did you gain 60 pounds in a week?'"

You're Not Being Honest With Yourself
"Catch some reality," she said. "Realistically, if you haven't been to the gym in a decade, you're not going to work out every day. That's the dumbest sh*t I've ever heard in my life." Unless you are hypermotivated and have superhuman resolve, she's 100 percent right. Hilariously so. Everyone's at a different point in their journey, so you need to choose the steps, plan, and tools that are specific to what you can reasonably accomplish. Don't follow a cookie-cutter plan just because someone you know had success on it.

You're Making Excuses
"Everybody's got time to binge-watch Netflix, but nobody's got time to work out."
"The biggest thing is excuses. I hate excuses. Everyone has an excuse," she said. "I don't want to hear about your thyroid, I don't wanna hear, 'Oh I'm so busy.' Everybody's got time to binge-watch Netflix, but nobody's got time to work out."

Latreal described clients and people who inspire her, like a power lifter with one leg who still hits the gym, a woman who had brain cancer but still turned her life around with nutrition (and lost 70 pounds, and became a certified trainer), and a contestant on Dancing With the Stars who was once in a vegetative state for four years and was told she wasn't going to live.

"When I see stories like that, you realize there's no excuse. If you really want something, you're going to go get it," Latreal explained.

The Solution
"Limit yourself" is probably not the weight-loss advice you were expecting, but it makes sense. "Set realistic goals," she said. Latreal suggested setting one or two small goals per week, like just eating breakfast each day and drinking more water. "Set a goal for yourself that every day for one week, you're going to wake up early enough to eat breakfast."

Once you feel like you've mastered that small task (which might be harder than you think), only then should you start to tack on more responsibilities.

"What would you realistically do?" she posed. "Realistically, you might work out two times a week for a month. After that month, try working out three times a week." Break things down into smaller goals. "I would love to see people really start to set themselves up for success, and that would be the way to do it," she said. "Know that you're not going to look like KhloÈ Kardashian in a week."

"Get rid of the excuses and set yourself up for success," she said. "That's how you keep yourself from failing."




Latreal wasn't taking any of former contestant Sukhda's excuses (and had zero time for her bad attitude). Sukhda ended up leaving the show because of her complete lack of progress and disregard for the program.

"Get rid of the excuses and set yourself up for success."
Many of us can be like that Revenge Body contestant at some point: stubborn, frustrated, and reluctant to put in the work. Latreal has seen firsthand how and why people fail on these programs and all the mistakes they make along the way. She also knows exactly how to stop that from happening! If you're scratching your head wondering why you can't seem to stick to a diet or fitness program, here's what she thinks might be the issues.







#1: You Can Afford Anything. You Just Canøt Afford Everything.

Donøt tell me your values.

Show me how you spend your money, and Iøll know what you value.

Donøt tell me, for example, that you øcanøt affordø to save money, travel the globe or plan for retirement if youøre simultaneously buying nice clothes and hitting the bars.

Thereøs nothing wrong with clothes and bars if itøs a deliberate, conscious choice. But donøt claim that bigger goals are out-of-reach. Youøre the captain of your own ship. Spend with your eyes open.

Donøt utter the self-defeating phrase øI canøt afford it.ø Thatøs weak. Itøs disempowering. Itøs a limiting belief.

Instead, ask yourself: øHow do I afford everything else in my life? How do I afford my iPad? My new-ish car? My restaurant habit?ø

Thereøs nothing wrong with buying an iPad and enjoying a five-star meal. The problem emerges when you blindly adopt those habits while simultaneously claiming that you øcanøt affordø something else.

#2: Look for Answers, Not Obstacles.

With the exception of, say, colonizing Jupiter or understanding why Celine Dion is so popular, you can accomplish pretty much anything.

It wonøt be easy. It wonøt be fast. But you can make sh*t happen.

Start a fist-fight with your limiting beliefs.

Instead of saying øI canøt,ø start phrasing your questions with, øHow can I?ø

For example:

Instead of: øI canøt save another dime.ø
Try: øHow can I shave an extra $50 from this monthøs spending?ø
Instead of: øI canøt find any good real estate investments nearby.ø
Try: øHow can I find good real estate deals? How can I get comfortable with foreclosure auctions and short sales? How can I find properties that arenøt MLS-listed? How can I invest in other cities and towns that have better deals? How else can I get creative?ø



When you fail, when you fuck up, you canøt just say youøve learned a lesson and move on, you also have to take it seriously and burn it into your mind so you never repeat it.



Will you make excuses today? Or will you go after your dreams.  


Discipline




“If I gave you a thousand dollars for every day you did these exercises at home, would you do them?”

The question was a no-brainer. For a thousand bucks, of course I’d do my physical therapy exercises at home. Duh.

“So all these lines you’re giving me this week: I don’t have time, I’m too tired, I forgot…they’re just excuses. If I gave you a thousand bucks a day, you’d find a way to do these.”

How often do we fall into this trap? We know incorporating strength exercises into our daily routine will prevent running injuries, yet we “don’t have the time” to do a few squats. We order a pizza, because it’s just “not possible” to cook a healthy meal tonight. We’re very aware of the dangers of prolonged sitting, yet we’re “too tired” to use a standing desk for an hour or go for a walk instead of watching TV after dinner.

All those excuses? They’re just excuses. We spin a yarn of how something is “simply impossible,” because it’s much more comfortable to say “I can’t” than to honestly admit “I don’t want to,” “I’m feeling lazy,” or “I can’t do it my way, so I won’t do it at all.”

The so-called “impossibles” become very possible with a bit of perspective. What would happen if someone offered up a thousand bucks to do those things you’re “too busy” or “too tired” to do today?

I’d bet most of us would suddenly catch a second wind.

Stop with the excuses. What do ìI donít have timeî, ìI donít have enough money to start a business,î and ìIíll start tomorrowî all have in common? They are all bull$h@t. You either do something or you donít. Thatís it ó thereís no grey area here. Get started right now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Right now. Think of it this way: the longer you wait, the more potential income you are losing. Be proactive, start small, and figure out how to move your career forward yourself with the means you have at your disposal. There is ALWAYS a way to get things done. Our generation is already full of big talkers, so I suggest you not add to the noise.

The thing to take away from all of this is that, no one is going to fix your problem for you. Life can be cruel, it’s up to you to punch it in the face. No matter how much you complain, no one is going to simply hand you a solution. They’re not even going to fight for you. The best you could hope for is that they’ll be able to relate and be motivated to go to bat with you. But even then, they’re not fixing your problem, they’re fixing their own (the two just happen to align).

Don’t be afraid to fight for what you want. Don’t be afraid to fail. Don’t be afraid to try again. You only get one life, so do your damnedest to screw it up. If you can get really good at failing, eventually you’ll fail at that, and wind up with a success. The only way to avoid failure altogether is to sit on your ass. But if you ask me, that’s the greatest failure of all.

When I was younger, I tended to look for external reasons when any situation did not work out in my favor. I attributed bad results to things outside my control. For example, if I was late to the office, it was because traffic was worse than I expected. If I was going deeper into debt, it was because I wasn’t getting paid enough by my employer to cover my basic necessities in addition to my costs to transport myself to the office every day. My approach to life required me to believe that many of the bad things that happened to me were brought on by external events, things which I could not control.

Eventually, I came to realize that I had much more control over my life. I learned to accept every moment as a choice, and that I had no one to blame for any bad circumstances but myself. While there are certainly situations that are affected by uncontrollable external forces, but these make up a very small percent of the factors that affect my life.

Most of us spend too little time using our imaginations. We wake up, brush our teeth, get dressed, go to work, come home, eat dinner, watch TV, poop, and repeat the cycle over and over again. Let’s make room for some meditation, some investment idea hunting, and some creativity. I bet if we set aside more time to think differently, we can do much more, be much more, and earn much more.

I’ve learned long ago that you can’t force anybody to do anything. They’ve got to experience some sort of hardship on their own before they are willing to change. Maybe it takes a heart attack to stop eating so poorly. Or maybe it takes a massive market correction to not be 100% allocated in stocks. Whatever the financial situation may be, only experience can really have an affect on someone’s outlook.

Probably the biggest conundrum I encounter on a regular basis are complaints from people who are unhappy with their existing financial situation, but who arenøt doing everything possible to improve. There are actually people out there who only work 40 hours a week or less who complain about their financial situation! Why not just try harder to get ahead? Why attack someone who has what you have instead of working on yourself? We are only owed what we deserve.

Waste Time Feeling Sorry for Themselves. You donít see mentally strong people feeling sorry for their circumstances or dwelling on the way theyíve been mistreated. They have learned to take responsibility for their actions and outcomes, and they have an inherent understanding of the fact that frequently life is not fair. They are able to emerge from trying circumstances with self-awareness and gratitude for the lessons learned. When a situation turns out badly, they respond with phrases such as ìOh, well.î Or perhaps simply, ìNext!î

If everything worked out perfectly in your life, what would you be doing in ten years?

I had to stop making excuses and embrace a sense of urgency. My obesity was all my fault. All of it. Oh, I told myself otherwise. I complained about my long commute, that I couldnøt find the time, the energy, that I didnøt like the gym, that I couldnøt exercise hard enough to have an affect. The bottom line was: I was weak.

The best thing you can do for yourself is to stop saying ìI wish,î start saying ìI will,î and then go do something about it.  The world isnít going to dominate itself.  You just have to wake up one morning and decide that you donít want to feel like this anymore, ever again.  And then make a change, just like that.

Step 2: Start small, then go big later on

When youøre starting out with any goal ø like exercising ø itøs better to actually start than to dream about starting it forever. With exercising that means ACTUALLY walking one mile once per week is better than to PLANNING to run three miles 3x per week ø and never starting.

Each one mile you walk represents a ølittle winø for your goal.

And a lot of those little wins is what pushes us forward and helps us succeed. Because with each little milestone we achieve, weøre actually doing what we set out to doønot just wishing and waiting on whims.

Once you know this, you can focus on incorporating more ølittle winsø into your life to boost your confidence and build momentum into your goals.

Hereøs how to use ølittle winsø for your goals:

Instead of planning to do 100 pushups per day to get back in shape, just do two pushups a day to get started
Instead of thinking you have to floss all your teeth, just focus on one tooth a day to get things going
Instead of trying to drink a gallon of water a day instead of soda, just drink one glass of water before you go to bed.
Instead of starting a million dollar business from scratch, just focus on getting your first paying client.
And you can ramp up from there. But you donøt want to fail from the start.

What you can do now: Think of one big thing youød like to accomplish (getting fit, learning a new language, cleaning your house). Then break that down to the TINIEST steps you can imagine. And I mean SERIOUSLY tiny: 2 push ups per day, 1 tooth, one glass of waterøhowever small you needøMake it something you KNOW you can do.
