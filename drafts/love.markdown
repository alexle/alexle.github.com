I just think I love the game. ItÕs easy to do this when you love it. I think the point is, if you find something you love to do, it never feels like work. I found football, and I found it at a young age, and I just loved it. ÒItÕs hard to explain - I just love the preparation, I love the offseason, I love the film work. I think a big part of it is because my body feels good and IÕve worked hard [at that]. ... I think for a lot of older players, their body doesnÕt respond. And football is no fun when youÕre hurting.Ó


For many years in the beginning of my career I’d been more than happy to work for free or even at a loss as long as the work was interesting. I was so totally in love with computer programming and the feeling I got from making something work and then seeing that creation be used by other people that I completely lost sight of the value that I was creating.



Jiro: ¿Once you decide on your occupation¿ you must immerse yourself in your work. You have to fall in love with your work. Never complain about your job. You must dedicate your life to mastering your skill. That¿s the secret of success and is the key to being regarded honorably.¿

Make the second thing you like most as your job, and keep the thing you like most as your hobby. 


Master you job and enjoy your hobbies. Remember your job is work and it's designed to make you money. Your hobbies are your fun things.

The truth is, we are, as a species, pretty bad at predicting what will make us happy.

Happiness is a moving target and what makes you happy in one context won¿t necessarily make you happy in another once other variables have changed.

WeÕre doing people an incredible disservice by telling them they should seek, and pursue, what they love. People usually canÕt differentiate what they really love and what they love the idea of.

But more importantly, you are not meant to do what you love. You are meant to do what youÕre skilled at. Imagine an aspiring doctor with a low IQ but a lot of Òpassion.Ó They wouldnÕt make it through medical school, and you wouldnÕt want them to.



1. People always say, ¿Make sure you get a job doing what you love!¿ But that isn¿t the best advice. The right job is the job you love some days, can tolerate most days, and still pays the bills. Almost nobody has a job they love every day.


What you love is very often not something that you feel immediate passion for. It doesnâ€™t smack you in the face after 10 minutes and tell you that this is something youâ€™re going to do for the rest of your life. That happens only very rarely, or in the movies. 

Love doesnâ€™t start out as a hurricane that sweeps through your life and changes everything in an instant. It starts out as a seed. Barely alive, easily overlooked, fragile and small. But given attention love grows. Given proper care it sprouts and springs up through the dirt. Given years to blossom it buds flowers and grows branches, snaking its way through your life until it consumes it entirely. Given enough care the thing that you love becomes the lens through which you see the world. 

But itâ€™s so easy to miss because it starts out as something so tiny. It starts out as something that you did without even realizing it. When youâ€™re bored on a Saturday afternoon, your friends arenâ€™t around, and youâ€™re looking for something to do. Maybe you sit down and play piano. Maybe you write on your blog. Maybe you fire up TextMate and start coding. 

Everyone has something like this. And even though it may not look like it, that is the seed of love. Because it may start as something that you just do when youâ€™re bored. But given attention and time you start to get better at it. You start to figure out the ins and outs, to gain skill. You probably donâ€™t even notice that this is happening.

I started coding in 10 years ago. I wish I could say that I LOVED it from the beginning. That I was passionate about it, and that I knew instantly that it would shape my life.

Nope, not even  a little bit.

It was just something I did when I was bored on the weekends. But given time and attention it has grown from a seed quivering silently underground into a Redwood tree with long, slender branches touching every corner of my life and roots planted deeply in my soul. 

I know that I canâ€™t imagine my life without it. And that, I believe, is what love is. 

For most people, itâ€™s easy to be passionate about things that are working out, and that distorts our impression of the importance of passion. Iâ€™ve been involved in several dozen business ventures over the course of my life, and each one made me excited at the start. You might even call it passion.

The ones that didnâ€™t work outâ€”and that would be most of themâ€”slowly drained my passion as they failed. The few that worked became more exciting as they succeeded. For example, when I invested in a restaurant with an operating partner, my passion was sky high. And on day one, when there was a line of customers down the block, I was even more passionate. In later years, as the business got pummeled, my passion evolved into frustration and annoyance.

On the other hand, Dilbert started out as just one of many get-rich schemes I was willing to try. When it started to look as if it might be a success, my passion for cartooning increased because I realized it could be my golden ticket. In hindsight, it looks as if the projects that I was most passionate about were also the ones that worked. But objectively, my passion level moved with my success. Success caused passion more than passion caused success.

 If "following your dream" full time is going to put your out on the street, break up your relationship, hurt your family, make you bankrupt, and make you hate that passion, maybe you should consider embracing your passion in a different way. Be realistic—you'll have plenty of time to be optimistic later. Right now, you need to make sure you're not planning your eventual ruin.


 And even then, who says you need to make money doing what you love? Since when does everyone feel entitled to love every fucking second of their job? Really, what is so wrong with working an OK normal job with some cool people you like, and then pursuing your passion in your free time on the side? Has the world turned upside-down or is this not suddenly a novel idea to people?

Look, here¿s another slap in the face for you: every job sucks sometimes. There¿s no such thing as some passionate activity that you will never get tired of, never get stressed over, never complain about. It doesn¿t exist. I am living my dream job (which happened by accident, by the way. I never in a million years planned on this happening; like a kid on a playground I just went and tried it), and I still hate about 30% of it. Some days more.

Again, that¿s just life.  Life doesn¿t work like that. It¿s just unrealistic. There¿s a thing most of us need called balance.

A feeling of opportunity drives the new zeitgeist. People feel they have the freedom to choose, as such, they choose to spend their lives on something that matters. With this, a new category of companies is emerging; capitalistic but with purpose.

Considering Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, it is not surprising that as our needs are covered, we seek higher purpose. But this new breed of employees takes it further; they are willing to substitute a considerable part of the material wealth otherwise available to them to achieve purpose. Some actively try to reduce their worldly possessions; others have just realized that the big house and the extra car don’t make them happy. They would prefer making an impact.

All around me, I see successful corporate executives actively looking for companies where they can have a bigger impact. As cofounder of Startup Village, I am contacted weekly by successful people who are looking for the right startup company to join, even if it costs them half their salary and their company car. They just don’t feel fulfilled by their corporate jobs, they don’t feel like they are making a difference.

Even more so, I see this trend among the new generation that’s entering the workforce. Where top consulting companies with their inherent prestige used to be top of the list for new graduates, more and more now want to be independent and work on something they believe in.
