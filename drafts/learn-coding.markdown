I read with great interest a recent TechCrunch article from a developer named Basel Farag. In “Please Don’t Learn to Code,” the author makes a compelling case as to why courses and bootcamps for everyday people to learn programming aren’t all they’re cracked up to be.
In a lot of ways, I agree with Basel.
Not everyone is cut out to be an engineer or programmer.
And as with so many professions, there’s a big difference between playing a few coding games to learn the basics and becoming a professional. It’s problematic when someone who lacks a certain depth of knowledge or experience accepts the responsibility to complete a task they aren’t qualified to do.
On that, we agree.
But I have to take exception with this statement from the first paragraph of that article:
“Everyone should learn to code. But here’s the problem with that idea: Coding is not the new literacy.”
Isn’t it?
In his explanation of why learning to code doesn’t make one a programmer, Basel missed a very important point: Not everyone wants to be a programmer.
Coding has so many incredibly useful, important applications in many facets of business and marketing.
Take, for example, the entrepreneur who has funding to hire just two programmers for her startup. How is she to evaluate the expertise and experience of those programmers without some basic understanding of what it is they do?
Or consider the small local business owner who’s finally hired his first marketing firm. They’ve set him up with a great content management system (CMS), but it would be so much more cost and time efficient for him to make some of the smaller website changes he finds himself needing from time to time if he could just do it himself.
Heck, my entire pay-per-click (PPC) software company sprang from a piece of software I built for myself to automate some of the repetitive tasks I had to do in PPC advertising consulting.
Here are just a few of the business reasons people learn how to code:
As Steve Jobs famously said, coding teaches you how to think and solve problems.
You can do more for yourself online, which is a huge plus for cash-strapped startups.
Communication with programmers and IT improves as you can speak their language and understand their challenges.
You’ll gain more and better insight into product development.
You’ll have a better understanding of the increasingly technology-driven world around you (and your company).
It makes evaluating software and apps you might use in your business easier, and your insights more meaningful.
You just might develop your own timesaving, automated solutions to make life easier.
Let’s rid ourselves of the idea that only geeks and techies need to learn how to program — it’s just not true.
Coding isn’t trendy or some kind of fad. It’s the language that drives much of our world today, from the wearable devices we’re now sporting, to the tools we use in the workplace, to the smart appliances in our homes.
Coding IS the new literacy.
