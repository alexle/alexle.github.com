How many of you haven’t slept for a full 8 hours in the past month? If you are deep into the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency space, I would say about 99% think sleeping is overrated and would rather watch the markets. Yet people who sleep less than the recommended 7 to 8 hours per night are more likely to suffer from chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, diabetes and even dementia, experts say. Research found that people who averaged 4 hours of sleep were 4 times more likely to catch colds. What is the point of accumulating wealth if you will end up suffering disease and illnesses in the future, or even today?

A lot of Crypto traders and Bitcoin startup people also end up neglecting their physical well-being. Exercise takes a back seat, more time sitting in an office in front of a computer, and unhealthy diets of coffee and fast food are common. Again, you might have a lot of coins, but what’s the point if you will end up spending that for medical bills?

A crashing market is not a real problem in the grand scheme of things. You can always earn lost money back. But when your health deteriorates from neglect, it will take a lot more to get back to health.

Take a few hours per day to invest in some exercise, even just taking short walks will do wonders for your health. Invest in a class like yoga or boxing to release some of the stresses that come with this industry. Make sure you get enough sleep so that you can attack the next day sharper and in better mental condition.
