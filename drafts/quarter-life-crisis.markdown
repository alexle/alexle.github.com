Stop Comparing Your Behind-the-Scenes with Everyone's Highlight Reel





My conversations with this incredible little girl have opened my awareness to all the self-destructive fantasies I have in my head.  I have it so good—I am incredibly fortunate to be alive and healthy, for example—and yet I sit at home most nights thinking the opposite.  I don’t necessarily do this consciously or intensely, but I do it.  I fantasize about how my life ‘should’ be different than it is—how everything should be better, easier, more enjoyable, and so forth.  And these fantasies are slowly spoiling my attitude and my ability to make progress on the things that are important to me.”


	milestones. It is okay if you donøt finish school, get married, find a job that supports you, have a family, make money, and live comfortably all by this age, or that age. Itøs okay if you do, as long as you understand that if youøre not married by 25, or a Vice President by 30 ø or even happy, for that matter ø the world isnøt going to condemn you. You are allowed to backtrack. You are allowed to figure out what inspires you. You are allowed time, and I think we often forget that.






I’m desperate to hold onto the youth I feel slipping through my fingers, yet I want nothing more than the fabled stability adulthood brings. It’s a gut-wrenching feeling of fear, uncertainty, and an overwhelming desire for everything to just “be okay,” even though I don’t know what that means yet. But I do know I’m not the only one out there that feels like this. This monster is the quarter-life crisis, and it is very real for a lot of young people.



ESPN: In the last year or two, exploring things outside running, being a foster mom, writing the cookbook -- look, we all know you would have liked to run Boston last spring, and that some of the time off was forced [by injury]. How did all of that contribute to the way you performed Sunday?

SF: It was 100 percent a blessing. I couldn't see it initially at the time, but I can see now, being removed, that it was the best possible thing to happen to me. I was able to come back and have a physical reset. I needed that rest and I would never have given it to myself otherwise. I have felt so much better, which makes it so much more fun to train, when you feel good. I hadn't realized how tired I was. I had dug myself a hole. When you're trying to chase these goals, it's easy to think you're just not working hard enough, you're not getting the win and you're not doing your job. The reality was, I was probably overworking and underestimating my talent, because I was chasing, at times, people who were doped up. So I was chasing this impossible goal, basically, because they weren't real, the performances weren't real.


Millennials are the least engaged generation at work. Whether it’s the fact that they didn’t land their dream job after college, that they feel alienated from their colleagues, or that they’re uninspired by their daily grind – there’s a mounting sense of apathy that continues to plague the job satisfaction levels of many young professionals.




Determine what you can control.

In reality, there are many things in life you have zero control over. You canøt force your spouse to change, you canøt prevent a storm from happening, and you canøt control how other people feel. Sometimes, all you can control is your effort and your attitude. When you put your energy into the things you can control, youøll be much more effective.






Corrie ten Boom says,“Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow, it empties today of its strength.”


As Angel and I watched a rerun of the Academy Awards last night, we both noticed an obvious commonality between many of the speeches the winners on stage made when they accepted their awards.  If you stripped the details out of each speech, 90% of them boiled down to:

øI am so thankful.  My whole life has been leading up to this moment.ø

The most interesting thing about this sentiment, in my opinion, is that regardless of a human beingøs social status, wealth, age, or unique situation, their whole life has undoubtedly been leading up to every present moment of their life.  Think about that for a second.  This reality might seem more significant on stage at a high-stakes awards ceremony, but itøs equally significant to all of us.  Every single thing youøve gone through in life ø every high, every low, and everything in between ø has all led you to the moment youøre experiencing right now.

This means that you are exactly where you need to be to get to where you want to go.  Itøs just a matter of taking one new step in the right direction, and another, and another.

So, never assume that youøre stuck with the way things are right now.  You arenøt.

Things can change if you want them to, at any age.  Life changes every single moment, and so can YOU! How old will you be in 10 years if you donøt do it?

Exactly 10 years older than you are today ø the same exact age youøll be in 10 years if you actually follow through and DO IT!

But instead of feeling proud of the lessons youøve learned and the progress youøve made, youøll feel an inevitable sense of regret that comes from never even trying.

Time will have passed with nothing new to show for it.

You will have grown older, without getting any closer to what you ultimately want.

Let that sink in for a moment.


Youíre working a full-time job that youíre ìmehî about, but you have no idea what you want to do next. Youíre still figuring out exactly what you want to be when you grow up. Maybe you need help figuring out how your certain set of skills can land you your dream job. 

#Tip: Remember that everyone is at a different stage in their professional journey. Think about what makes you happy in your career and beyond, and establish goals that help you work towards your definition of success.


By now youøve likely heard of the quarter-life crisis ø a period of insecurity and doubt that many people in their mid 20s to early 30s go through surrounding their career, relationships, and finances. Chances are good you may experience your own. In fact, 75% of 25-33 year olds have experienced a quarter-life crisis, often related to feeling like they are at a crossroad in their career.





In today's fast-paced world, we are all in a hurry. In a hurry to get to where we are going, in a hurry to get successful, in a hurry to get things done. We get dejected when things don't happen our way, when results are not achieved instantly. It's a race and we are scared of being left behind. The age of  achievement has decreased. Fifteen-year-olds are developing codes and selling websites. By the time you are 25, you have a company of your own. Or you are an accomplished musician who has travelled the world. People are doing too much in too little time. Only some people.

And that is scaring the hell out of us. If at 25, you are still slogging it out in a 9-to-6 job, you feel worthless. All your friends are getting married and posting pictures of their honeymoon to New Zealand or some exotic destination you can't even afford to think of in the next 2 years. Time is running out; the world is running past you and youøyou find yourself struggling to even get up from bed. 

Relax. Take a deep breath. Don't compare yourself with others. The world is full of all kinds of people ø those who get successful early in life and those who do later. There are those who get married at 25 but divorced at 30, and there are also those who find love at 40, never to part with them again. Henry Ford was 45 when he designed his revolutionary Model T car. A simple WhatsApp forward message makes so much sense here:
øYou are unique, don't compare yourself to others.
Someone graduated at the age of 22, yet waited 5 years before securing a good job; and there is another who graduated at 27 and secured employment immediately!
Someone became CEO at 25 and died at 50 while another became a CEO at 50 and lived to 90 years.
Everyone works based on their 'Time Zone'. People can have things worked out only according to their pace.
Work in your øtime zoneø. Your Colleagues, friends, younger ones might "seem" to go ahead of you. May be some might "seem" behind you. Everyone is in this world running their own race on their own lane in their own time. God has a different plan for everybody. Time is the difference.
Obama retires at 55, Trump resumes at 70. Don't envy them or mock them, it's their 'TimeZone.' You are in yours!ø 

Early success doesn't mean a happy life. You could open a company at 25, you could also go bankrupt at 30 if the company dissolves. You could find success at 40, and perhaps you'd be more well-equipped to handle it then. Whatever happens, happens for a reason. 
Maybe that lost job was not right for you. Maybe you are meant to hone your skills for something great later. There is no right time. We get things when we are ready for them. When it doesn't happen for you, it means it's not supposed to happen right now. No point worrying yourself sick and envying another.  
Spend your time polishing your personality, acquiring new skills, learning a new language ø create the person you want to be in future. Create the personality that will match your success. Work towards your goal at your own pace. Everybody has their own timeline. What if you are meant to do something worthwhile in some years when you are older and wiser, but you were too busy feeling bad about yourself and drowning your woes in alcohol. Imagine the regret. 
Opportunities never cease to come. If today is not your day, it could be tomorrow. Don't stop living your life just because it isn't happening.
