we can't justify spending that kind of money on a car. I'd rather go on a fabulous trip... every year... for a decade.





Principle #5: øLivingø and øHaving Funø Are Not Predicated on Spending Money
What exactly does a person mean when they talk about ølivingø and øhaving funø? Is it really just spending money? Is spending money the primary source of ølivingø and øhaving funø?

If the only way to øliveø and øhave funø is to shell out cash, youøre locking out a lot of opportunities in your life.

Try to seek out things that you consider to be ølivingø and øhaving funø that donøt involve spending money. I have a long list of things I enjoy doing that donøt involve spending money and thatøs what I tap for my own leisure time.

Here are 10 of those things: 
ø I enjoy reading books Iøve checked out from the library. 
ø I enjoy hiking in the parks and wooded areas near my home. 
ø I enjoy going to a community board game night in my area. 
ø I enjoy making food at home, particularly fermented foods like sauerkraut and homemade items like pasta. 
ø I enjoy having potluck dinner parties at my house. 
ø I enjoy looking at the community calendar and doing something pretty much at random in my community. 
ø I enjoy doing exercises in my living room. 
ø I enjoy working on lettering and calligraphy. 
ø I enjoy gardening. 
ø I enjoy learning about new topics from Wikipedia or from free online classes.

Come up with your own list. If you have a repertoire of things to






Your 20s can one of the most memorable times of your life. After all, youøve just started to enter the workforce, have little responsibility and finally have a disposable income to call your own. However, even with all the freedom that youth provides, it can come with some significant financial consequences that can be crippling if youøre not careful.

While most people would consider themselves pretty financially savvy, I'd say that can be attributed to the fact that no wants to admit they're bad with money. As cash rules almost every decision we make, it can be tough to swallow when we havenøt held ourselves to the best standard.

Granted, for most of us, itøs easier said than done, but thatøs why getting into good habits while youøre young is so imperative. Thatøs why Iøve compiled a few tips I wish I knew when I was in my 20s. Following these could lend you a better path and help you save quite a bit as well.





Yes, spending money on what makes you happy is perfectly okay, but thereøs an extremely important catch.

Donøt waste money on things that arenøt important to you. There is a big difference, and here is where most people get it completely wrong.

What makes you happy is not decided by your friends, your neighbors, or the commercials on TV.

Just because the car industry spends billions of dollars every year trying to convince you that parting with $30,000 of your hard earned money will make you feel good, doesnøt make it true. Just because your friends enjoy spending lavishly on clothes, doesnøt mean thatøs for you. Maybe you enjoy travel more. Maybe you enjoy something else entirely.


By opting out of excessive consumerism, you no longer trade your hard worked time for material goods. Instead, that time and effort is retained. Itøs not gifted away to a restaurateur or a car manufacturer, but itøs held by you, ready to be cashed for freedom.





Here are some common goals for your money to consider:

* Not having to work as much so you can spend more time with your child.

* Being able to comfortably pay for your child’s education and help him out when he stumbles.

* Having the option to take a new job you love that doesn’t pay well.

* Helping your parents and in-laws with financial matters.

* Spending your time on a cause or donating to a cause that has special meaning to you.



The Trend Toward Less

I have always been a fan of frugality in the truest sense of the word. I like efficiency, not only with spending, but also with time, energy, and even material goods. I donøt like clutter or waste. I hate keeping things I donøt use. Itøs never been a moral thing as much as a personal preference, most likely rooted in the fact that my mind is always cluttered and simplifying my environment seems to help me feel a little less anxious, confused, and distracted. For me, less is good.

Thereøs been a huge movement toward minimalism, efficiency, and frugality lately. You see it everywhere, not just documentaries and books. You see it in the mid-century modern coffee shop that opened up down the street. Or on the hottest HGTV show about tiny houses.


Like it or not, money represents flexibility, freedom, choices, value and, ultimately, power. When you have money, you donøt have to make desperate decisions that spiral you into a lifetime of debt. When you have money, you donøt have to depend on someone else to support you. When you have money, you have more flexibility to leave your shit job. These cliches about money being the root of all evil tell people that money doesnøt matter, but it does. 







You would have more money for the things you want if you stopped foolishly wasting it on other things.


oIn each case above, the person wanted money, but had already spent it elsewhere. My friend could afford to replace her cell phone if she hadnít purchased such an expensive car. My other friend could have made significant inroads on their family debt if they hadnít bought season tickets for the summer. And most of us would have more room for generosity and supporting causes we believe in if consumerism wasnít so prevalent in us.

When we haphazardly spend money on foolish things, we have less remaining for more important pursuits. 

oThrough a number of odd circumstances, I happened to spend some significant time talking with the friend of a friend recently. The topic of conversation was stress and anxiety. More specifically, the topic was her anxiety which she attributed to their financial circumstances: a burdensome mortgage, a monthly car payment, and not enough financial margin to feel comfortable.

The reason for the stress and anxiety, seemed to me, was not about the unacquisition of sufficient funds. The reason for the stress and the anxiety was the foolish places where their money was goingótoo big a house, too fancy a car, and too many unintentional purchases in the past.

They had sacrificed peace and calm for square footage and expensive wheels.]


Our financial situations certainly vary from person to person. And I fully understand that some people struggle financially because of no fault of their own. But I believe the principle stated above extends to a higher percentage of us than you might think.

The greatest mistake we can make is the assumption that our financial lives are entirely outside of our control. They are not. We decide every day where our money is going to be spent.

Intentionally choosing to spend money on the things we truly want is not always easy. It requires a clear designation of the financial reality we wish was true (our desires) and a clear understanding of the reason it is not (our foolish spending habits).

Depending on your financial goals, the application may look something like this:

I want to get out of debt, I will spend less on eating out.
I want more money for travel, I must I must spend less on my housing.
I want more financial peace, I need to remove my monthly car payment.
I want more margin for generosity, I must spend less on fashion or furniture or technology.
I want more ___________ so I need to buy less ______________.
What causes us to lose sight of this simple truth? Iím not sure. But none of us are immune from it. Which is probably one of the reasons it is so difficult to articulate when we see it playing out in another personís life.

3. Less expenses means more money

When I lived in New York City, I made enough money to not have to think twice about buying the stuff that I really wanted. I could afford to eat out several times a week, treat myself to drinks on the weekend, and occasionally buy nice clothes. I used to spend hundreds of dollars on trendy, fast fashion every month that would hardly be worn and go out of style shortly thereafter. In retrospect, the quick and fleeting ‚Äúhits‚Äù of joy I got from indulging in these habits were not worth the colossal waste of money.

It may seem like an obvious statement to make, but I can‚Äôt stress it enough: when we spend less, we have more money. I guarantee that if we take a good, honest look at our budgets, most of us will find more frivolous expenses than we‚Äôd like to admit. For example, hefty monthly subscriptions to gyms we don‚Äôt attend or streaming devices we hardly use, overpriced coffees, clothes that sit in our closets untouched, or food that was purchased and not consumed.

By taking a step back and evaluating what we really need to live a fulfilling life, we can spend significantly less. Minimalism is so much different than being cheap ‚Äì we don‚Äôt need to count pennies or deprive ourselves of necessities to generate more wealth. Rather, reducing our excessive expenditure helps us have more money to focus on what does matter to us. In my case, living a more minimalist lifestyle has significantly liberated my funds, which I can re-direct towards following my dream of traveling the world. In the end, my greatest source of wealth has not been measured in dollars, but rather in the time and opportunity that I now have to pursue a lifestyle that I desire.




Frugality gives you options.


When you have money in the bank‚Äìand aren‚Äôt living paycheck-to-paycheck‚Äìyou have options in how to deploy your two most precious resources: time and money.

Conversely, when you‚Äôre in debt or spending right up to your means, you don‚Äôt have any option except to keep working‚Äìand probably harder and longer‚Äìno matter what else might happen in your life. Having a new baby and want to take extra time off? Too bad. Parent enduring a health crisis and you want to take six months off to care for them? Too bad. Just got word your friends are sailing around the world next year and invited you to join them? Too bad, you have to work.



The less money you need in order to enjoy your version of the good life and the more money you have saved up, the more freedom you have to pursue the life you want. Without the burden of debt or the incessant call of consumerism or the pressure to keep up with the standards and expectations of other people, you can craft a life that you enjoy living every single day.

Frugality isn‚Äôt necessarily about retiring early or even quitting your job at all‚Äìit‚Äôs about knowing that your financial security isn‚Äôt inextricably linked to your paycheck. If you were to unexpectedly lose your job, or need a new roof, or your dog got sick, you‚Äôd have the financial wherewithal to manage these crises without going into debt, thanks to frugality.

Financial independence isn‚Äôt about whether or not you enjoy your job‚Äìit‚Äôs about how reliant upon it you are.

And on the positive side, if you realize you want to follow a dream that‚Äôs low (or no) paying‚Äìfrugality can enable that. Frugality is insuring yourself for every iteration of life‚Äìthe good and the bad. Even if you think you‚Äôll work forever and never get fired and never get sick, frugality gives you a level of financial stability that translates into life stability.

Knowing that Mr. FW and I can provide for our family‚Äôs needs irrespective of whether or not we ever earn another dollar is one of the more peace-inspiring bits of knowledge I carry with me on a daily basis. Frugality is a beautiful and continuous cycle: the less you spend, the more you save, and the more you save, the less you need to earn because the less you spend‚Ä¶ you see where I‚Äôm going with this.

Planning ahead for the future doesn‚Äôt necessitate knowing what that future‚Äôs going to be. Mr. FW and I don‚Äôt know exactly where we‚Äôll be in the future‚Äìprobably still here on our homestead‚Äìbut if we were to change our minds? We‚Äôll have the financial ability to do so.

When you spend everything you make‚Äìor save a paltry amount‚Äìyou‚Äôre limiting the options you‚Äôll have in the future. Life has this uncanny way of throwing unbelievable opportunities and challenges in our path.

Joyful frugality‚Äìwhich is what I advocate‚Äìembraces and encompasses everything that‚Äôs most important to you. It‚Äôs not about deprivation, it‚Äôs about spending only on what matters, which in turn causes you to structure a life that‚Äôs absent the hectic distractions of consumerism. 


* can help pay for children's college education, weddings .. can help family with housing/cars/emergencies

* can spend more time with children

* can pursue dream of traveling/living abroad

* can purse hobby dreams


Our consumer culture makes it so easy to fritter away money on ultimately meaningless junk that we don‚Äôt actually need. When we‚Äôre at the whims of marketers and advertisements, we‚Äôre not in control. How to use our money is being dictated to us. I prefer to dictate to my money.


Not spending takes more effort at first and it‚Äôs a conscious choice, but then after awhile, it becomes the easiest thing in the world‚Ä¶ No more shopping, no more browsing online stores, no more worrying about what to buy next, which gives me a lot more time for doing things I actually enjoy and that make me happy: yoga, hiking, playing with my daughter, beating Mr. FW at Scrabble (he‚Äôll win one day, I‚Äôm sure üòâ ), and drinking wine by our woodstove in the evenings.


I‚Äôm no longer beholden to how I think I should use my money‚ÄìI‚Äôm immune to advertisements that tell me my hair is too long, my pants too dated, my face too makeup-less, and my car too old. It no longer matters to me because I‚Äôm in a position of power. A position of being able to say no and to instead prioritize my true needs and my true wants.

Don‚Äôt let your spending prevent you from doing what you want with your life. Rather, let frugality sculpt the life you crave.
