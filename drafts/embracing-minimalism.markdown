What Minimalism Means To Me
04/01/2013



The Trend Toward Less

I have always been a fan of frugality in the truest sense of the word. I like efficiency, not only with spending, but also with time, energy, and even material goods. I donøt like clutter or waste. I hate keeping things I donøt use. Itøs never been a moral thing as much as a personal preference, most likely rooted in the fact that my mind is always cluttered and simplifying my environment seems to help me feel a little less anxious, confused, and distracted. For me, less is good.

Thereøs been a huge movement toward minimalism, efficiency, and frugality lately. You see it everywhere, not just documentaries and books. You see it in the mid-century modern coffee shop that opened up down the street. Or on the hottest HGTV show about tiny houses.




Like it or not, money represents flexibility, freedom, choices, value and, ultimately, power. When you have money, you donøt have to make desperate decisions that spiral you into a lifetime of debt. When you have money, you donøt have to depend on someone else to support you. When you have money, you have more flexibility to leave your shit job. These cliches about money being the root of all evil tell people that money doesnøt matter, but it does. 

No, money doesnøt equal happiness, but hereøs the problem: weøre telling people who already donøt have enough that having less is a good thing. For ten years of my professional life, I rarely asked for a raise, often worked for free, and was sorely underpaid. To cope with this, I repeated the same mantra: money doesnøt matter. It did not serve me well.

When people say money shouldnøt matter, all it does is give more power to those who already have it. Phrases like, øI wish everyone could be rich and famous so they can see that itøs not the answerø completely disregard the fact that for a lot of people, money is the answer. If you canøt pay rent and youøre about to get evicted, money is the answer. If you can barely afford to put food on the table for your family, money will solve that, too. It might be a good message for the top 10% of earners, but for the vast majority of the population, less money is not the solution. For most of us, money matters. 


anyone can be a minimalist, itøs a mindset not a matter of being perfect at it.

Let me repeat that: anyone can be a minimalist. It just means youøre trying to opt out of consumerism, trying to be more mindful of how you live your life, and trying to figure out whatøs important and whatøs not.

I began my journey into minimalism a little over a year ago, and soon began experiencing the benefits of having less and living a simpler life.




America, you might think that happiness is defined by the objects around you. It can be your house, your Xbox, your iPhone, your car, or the millions of products you can buy in a local supermarket for your eating pleasures. All around us are things we want or at least we are told we should want them, courtesy of the ubiquitous advertising that blankets our every waking step.

But what if you just stopped wanting things? You might find yourself living a life that's much richer in experiences and closer to happiness.

How to get there? Try minimalism.

Spending less time on cleaning or shopping means I have more time to spend with friends, go out, or travel on my days off. I have become a lot more active."


Another way to live simply is to not to take up much space in where you live.



Minimalism is taking over. Figures like Marie Kondo are becoming famous by spreading the gospel of throwing everything out and keeping just what you need.

The movement is most prominent in Japan, where the influence of Zen Buddhism instills a desire for simplicity. For them, less is more.

There's also practical concerns: It's cheaper to be a minimalist. And because Japan is regularly beset by earthquakes, it doesn't always make sense to have a lot of valuable possessions lying around in your house. Nearly half of earthquake injuries come from falling objects.

Take a fascinating look into the sparse aesthetic of minimalism:



Minimalism is not only an aesthetic trend about organization and a certain amount of possessions; rather, it is a mindset and an attitude toward life. Thinking as a minimalist means to stop wondering about things you don’t have, what you need, or what could make your life better simplifying your thoughts.

Time is the one thing we can never be certain about, so there’s no point wasting your present thinking about all the things we’re missing, thinking we’re going to be finally happy when we get that desired job, desired relationship, or whatever it may be; minimalist people significantly reduce their negative thoughts by focusing on what truly matters, investing their time being present, and feeling grateful for what they already have. And even if you don’t live a minimalist lifestyle by owning few possessions, thinking as one can brighten up your days.


Living with less (often called ‘minimalism’) is not meant to be a hardship. It’s about getting rid of all the excess and distilling life down to what’s essential: the things that give us joy, purpose and value. We’re not just talking the physical stuff; we’re also talking about our mental and emotional states and how they can be improved. Minimalism is about achieving a change in perspective and creating new habits to bring about a positive transformation in our life. The ultimate aim of having less is to live more.


Weekends became sacred, as these were the only two days I actually felt happy and in control, browsing my favourite bookshops and picking up books I hardly had time to read. In a nutshell, I only really lived two out of seven days a week and was far from happy.

What happened to me?

Then one day, I simply had enough of the way things were going and decided to change something.

In my darkest hour, I discovered there were other choices I could make. I didn't have to do a job I hated and that didn’t align with my values and passions. I could pursue my interests and make a living out of it. I didn't have to live a life that I dreaded now, only start living and enjoy life when I eventually retired. I didn't need all of this 'stuff' that kept me rooted in a life and job that sucked out my joy, hope and energy.

For many minimalists, the physical decluttering comes first, followed by a change in mindset and lifestyle. It was the other way round for me. With my new-found sense of purpose, it dawned on me that just like my previous job, my physical possessions were weighing me down.

Spurred on by the desire to only live with what I needed, and guided by the William Morris quote “Have nothing in your home that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful”, I embarked upon a major, two-day decluttering exercise. Room by room, I combed through everything I owned and asked myself if every object sparked joy, was useful, or added value to my life. If yes, it survived the cull. If no, it went into the donate or trash pile. Till this day, I still remember the deep sense of freedom that came over me when my house was decluttered and cleaned




 Once the burden of physical possessions had been removed, I discovered more time and money for the things that matter most," Becker says. "Ultimately, this is what minimalism does for us: It provides opportunity to pursue our greatest passions ø however we choose to define them."

At first glance, the minimalis''t lifestyle has a simple goal, øOwn fewer things.ø

However, below the surface, minimalism is about something much greater. It is about re-evaluating our pursuits, our habits and our motivations.

My family was introduced to minimalism eight years ago and immediately removed unneeded possessions from every room in our home. Today we own only a third of the items than we did prior. We have more time, more energy and less stress and distractions as a result. Plus weøve seen numerous financial benefits.

Here are eight ways minimalism can help maximize

 The structures we build, buy and rent to store our ever-increasing number of possessions is quite unbelievable. 

 Maya Angelou once said, øWe need much less than we think we need.ø This truth lies at the heart of minimalism. And it may be an important realization to maximize your pocketbook as well.


Although we lived simply, we found joy in simplicity. Incredible food, basic shelter and spending time with loved ones is all one really needs. Here are some pictures I took at the Shilin night market where they have the best street food and sell anything you can think of.

At some point during the flight back to the States, I thought to myself, Whatøs the point of grinding so hard to make more money? Iøm not any happier earning more than when I made much less after leaving my day job in 2012.

My entire mentality about challenging myself to always grow and make more money went completely away. I already had enough to be happy with my non-online income streams supporting the way. Downsizing to a smaller home in 2014 freed about about $50,000 a year in cash flow because I rented out my old home of 10 years.


It is about intentionality, and generosity, and selflessness, and deciding to live for more important things than bigger houses and fuller closets.

ake a moment to pause and remember who you truly are. Take the time to reflect on the things that have real and lasting meaning in your life.
Over the past decade, Angel and I have I paid more and more attention to the beauty and practicality of living a simpler life.  A life uncluttered by most of the chaos people fill their lives with, leaving us with space for what truly matters.  A life that isnøt constant busyness, worrying and stress, but instead contemplation, creation, and connection with people and projects we love.

Eventually I came to understand that the key to making the most of life is to be sure that there isnøt anything holding me backøto make sure that I am free


When I look back at my earlier posts, I see that in some ways Iøm still the same person, and in others I have grown a lot. Minimalism for me started out as just decluttering a few things so that it was easier for me to travel. Over the years, it has taken on a deeper meaning beyond getting rid of stuff. Itøs a tool I used to get the most of what I want from life.

Like every practice, the beginning was easyøhow to pare down, how to fit everything I owned into a suitcase, etc. The harder stuff came slowly over the yearsølike how to be grateful for what I have, and how to let go.



We buy things we donøt need, to impress people we donøt like.
Tyler Durden (Fight Club)

øTell me, what is it you plan to do / with your one wild and precious life?ø
Mary Oliver

 Simplicity is extremely important for happiness. Having few desires, feeling satisfied with what you have, is very vital: satisfaction with just enough food, clothing, and shelter to protect yourself from the elements. 

For almost a decade now, Angel and I have been learning to live a simpler life.

Not simpler as in ìmeager.î  Simpler as in ìmeaningful.î

Weíve been working on eliminating many of lifeís complexities so weíre able to spend more time with people we love and do more activities we love.  This means weíve been gradually getting rid of mental and physical clutter, and eliminating all but the essential, so weíre left with only that which gives us value.

Our overarching goal is living a life uncluttered by most of the things people fill their lives with, leaving us with space for what truly matters.  A life that isnít constant busyness, rushing and stress, but instead contemplation, creation and connection with people and projects we love.



A simpler life is about subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful.  Thus, you are wealthy in proportion to the number of unnecessary things you can afford to live without.
Simplifying is not merely seeing how little you can get by with ñ thatís poverty ñ but how efficiently you can put first things first, and use your time accordingly to pursue the things that make a difference and mean the most to you.



* Now does being a minimalist mean you turn into a miser?  No.  Does it mean that you don't care about making a living?  No.  Does it mean that you live like a pauper?  No.  In fact when you stop spending your money on items that you don't need, you end up having more money for things that will feed your soul, like travel, and hobbies

* It simply means re-evaluating what is important to you.

* clearing clutter, reducing your possessions, less waste
* figuring out what's necessary, how to be content with less

* However, one could easily imagine a " minimalist" lifestyle with very high spending levels ( e.g. travelling the world)

* I think "living a minimalist life" just involves adopting a philosophy that centers around removing the non-essential from your life. I don't know that anyone actually practices an ideal minimalist life, having nothing but a birthday suit and foraging for food and water. The main idea is that the more you strip away, the more you can focus on what is left, whether that be about material possessions or obligations taking up your time. 

* is not *just* about minimizing our material possessions, but about changing our attitudes toward waste and consumerism, and decluttering our mental spaces as well.

You can have anything you want ø but you canøt have everything you want. Being smart with money isnøt about giving up your plasma TV or your daily latte. Itøs about setting priorities and managing expectations, about choosing to spend only on the things that matter to you, while cutting costs on the things that donøt.

spend on the things I care about, and ferociously save on the things I donít.

Minimalism is a fantasy as well. People buy into it because itís a lovely idea, living with little, being content, having a spartan workspace and living room. I buy into it, absolutely. But minimalism doesnít have to be a fantasy: I also use it as a tool for mindfulness, for living more consciously, for remembering whatís important.

In the early 2000s, there was a cultural message that was beginning to spread through literature and film. Fight Club, American Beauty, and American Psycho all touted this message. Oversimplified, that message was: materialism is bad.

Consumerism, materialism and superficial

Lately, I’ve been reading Joshua Becker’s book Simplify about minimalist lifestyle. This is an inspiring book about removing clutters and stuff you don’t actually need from your life and enjoy your life –not the things.

Which you hold, holds you. Things you own actually begin to own you after some time. You clean them, organize them, buy them, sell them etc. More you own, the more time they rob from your lives.

There are more you should value more than possessions –God, family, relationships, character etc.

At the end of your life, you won’t care about how many hours you worked, you’ll just care about the time you spend with family and friends. You won’t care about your money but the difference you have made, the lives you changed and legacy you have left.

We were never meant to live life of collecting stuff. We were meant to live simply enjoying experiences of life, people and the journey of life – not the things of life.
 
Like a lot of people who’ve shifted away from a consumer lifestyle, Tammy now has more money to spend on what she loves because her needs are small. She’s not buying Stuff or keeping up a big apartment. She and her husband swapped their cars (and car payments) for bicycles.

Experiences, not Stuff
More and more people are moving away from conspicuous consumption towards a life of conscious consumption and saving. 


Fast forward ten years. Now the couch is tattered and stained, and the cushions have gotten lumpy. Remembering how perfect it was doesn’t make you happier now; it makes you sad that you’re sitting on a bumpy relic of your couch’s former greatness.

Let’s say instead you’d put that money into an experience. A vacation where you were bitten by mosquitoes, almost missed your flight, and lost your hiking boots at the resort. Ten years later, your mosquito bites are gone, the shoes are long forgotten, and the photographs of the beautiful waterfall you visited still hang on your bedroom wall. The vacation actually gets better with time, as you hold on to the happy memories and forget the hassles.

Finally, experiences pay off on the happiness meter because of their novelty. We grow bored with Stuff and then want more! newer! bigger! better! Stuff. But it’s not the Stuff we want more of, really. We’re looking to replace the happiness kick we got from the Stuff when it was new. This is why so many of us can be staring at a closet full of expensive clothes and think we have nothing to wear, or restlessly scroll through thousands of songs in our iPods finding nothing we want to hear.

My biggest secret to wealth is realizing just how little money it really takes to lead an extremely rich life. But the biggest battle I face in sharing it is the different perspective that is programmed into the modern rich-world consumer: the perspective that simplicity is deprivation, change is scary, and effort is something best paved over with convenience.

øWhat I want to speak toøis mindfulness,ø Julie said.

øWhen we purchase something, we often do it mindlessly,ø Geoff said. øAnd without thinking, do we really want this? Or is this an irrational decision in this moment?ø

øWhich, to me, is really indicative of most peopleøs desires and wants. We think we need something, we think want something, but as soon as our mind shifts away from it, itøs not really something we want anymore.ø




While weøre at it, letøs rethink the term ødownsizingø and all of its negative connotations. øWhether youøre an empty nester moving from a house into a condo, or a renter trading in a two-bedroom for a studio and a shorter work commute, many people now see downsizing their home as a step forward, not backward,ø 

Requiring less time, energy, and money, smaller living spaces provide greater lifestyle flexibility.ø

When you have a gym two blocks away, you donøt need space for a treadmill; when you can stop at the corner market every day on your way home from work, you donøt need a massive pantry.ø 




. But the same renters that are being priced out of New York, San Fran, etc are less interested in ønestingø in the conventional sense. Their priorities swing toward a life filled with meaningful work, rich experiences and time spent with friends. They donøt desire the overheadøfinancial or otherwiseøof a conventional living experience.

Our target demographic are so-called Millennials. Millennials prize experiences over stuff. They will sacrifice space for location. They are less likely to couple up, marry or have kids. The funny thing is, somewhere along the way weøve learned that øMillennialø is more of a mindset than an age group.
