The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life

Look, sleep is really really good for you. 




But what you might not know is how much damage our lack of sleep is doing.

Professor Matthew Walker, director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley, says we're now in the midst of a "catastrophic sleep loss epidemic".

Sleep deprivation (classified as getting less than 7 hours of sleep a night) has been linked to a host of diseases including Alzheimer's, cancer, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, stroke, hyperglycemia, and poor mental health, among other health issues.

Allow me to press a bit more. After just one night of only four or five hours sleep, your natural killer cells (the ones that attack the cancer cells that appear in your body every day) drop by 70 percent.

More than 20 large-scale epidemiological studies show that the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life. And we haven't even mentioned yet that you just have less energy and motivation when sleep deprived.

Problematically, getting at least 7 hours of sleep a night seems like a luxury to many of us. In fact, in 1942, less than 8 percent of the population was trying to get by on six hours or less sleep a night; in 2017, almost one in two people are.

So why aren't we getting enough sleep and what can we do?



1. Getting by with little sleep is glorified, needing enough is stigmatized.
Inundation is the new black. Lack of sleep is a badge of honor. But it's critical to realize how unnatural this point of view is and reverse it. As Walker put it,

"No one would look at an infant baby asleep, and say 'What a lazy baby!' We know sleeping is non-negotiable for a baby. But that notion is quickly abandoned as we grow up. When I give lectures, people will wait behind until there is no one around and then tell me quietly: 'I seem to be one of those people who need eight or nine hours' sleep.' It's embarrassing to say it in public."

Walker advises thinking of sleep as a kind of work, like going to the gym, albeit far more enjoyable. Commit to it.


Sleep deprivation can kill you — here's what sleeping less than 7 hours per night does to your body and brain


About a third of US adults don't get enough sleep.

And sleep deprivation has serious consequences for your brain and body.

Many people think they can get by on less than seven to nine hours a night — the amount of sleep doctors recommend for most adults — or say they need to sleep less because of work or family obligations.

Sleep deprivation is linked to a higher risk for certain cancers
Sleep deprivation and disrupted sleep schedules have been linked to increased risk for several cancers, most notably colon and breast cancers.

Skin doesn't heal as well from damage when you are tired, leading to skin aging
Poor sleep quality is strongly correlated with chronic skin problems, according to research from the University of Wisconsin. Studies have also found that when skin is damaged by the sun or other factors, it doesn't heal as well in poor sleepers, so those people wind up showing more signs of skin aging.

Several studies have found that sleep helps cleanse the brain of the beta-amyloid protein that can build up while you are awake. That protein is strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease. Researchers say that a lack of sleep can lead to a vicious cycle, since the more beta-amyloid protein there is in the brain, the harder it is to get to a cleansing deep-sleep state. People with more disrupted sleep schedules tend to have more beta-amyloid protein built up.
Heart disease risk rises with sleep deprivation

There's plenty of evidence that sleep deprivation has a negative effect on the heart. When researchers kept people awake for 88 hours, their blood pressure went up (no big surprise there). Even participants who were allowed to sleep for four hours a night showed an elevated heart rate when compared with those who got eight hours. Concentrations of C-reactive protein, a marker of heart-disease risk, also increase in people who are fully or partially deprived of sleep.




Sleep expert Matthew Walker is not a fan of the expression “you can sleep when you’re dead.”

In fact, he calls it “mortally unwise advice.”

“Sleep is Mother Nature’s best effort yet to counter death,” Walker says.

He would know. Walker, who is director of the University of California, Berkeley’s Center for Human Sleep Science, has been studying sleep for more than 20 years and is the author of a new book, “Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams.”

Walker’s work centers around a major and often overlooked problem: many Americans are sleep-deprived. One in three U.S. adults report they usually get less than the recommended seven hours, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This could be harming peoples’ health in myriad ways, Walker said: Insufficient sleep is linked to everything from Alzheimer’s disease to stroke, cancer and even suicide, and it doesn’t take that much lost sleep — just a loss of one hour in one single night.

That’s pushed Walker, who allots himself a “non-negotiable” eight hours of sleep each night, to become something of a sleep warrior.

Once you know the science, you honestly wouldn’t be doing anything else,” he said.s



 They have so many misconceptions. I think people probably don’t recognize the full deathly and disease-related consequence of insufficient sleep.

People dramatically underestimate how much sleep is linked to all the diseases killing us. We know a lack of sleep is linked to numerous forms of cancer — bowel, prostate, breast cancer.

They may not understand how little sleep reduction it takes. For example, if I put a somewhat healthy individual who has no history of diabetes on one week of five to six hours of sleep, by the end of that week their blood sugar is disrupted so profoundly that they would be classified by their doctor as pre-diabetic.

You don’t need to be going for one week on six hours — all it takes is one hour across one single night.

MarketWatch: So how many hours should we be getting?

Walker: Below seven hours of sleep, there are objective impairments in the body. Eight hours are recommended.

MarketWatch: What about people who say they can survive on fewer hours of sleep?

Walker: Based on the science, you can make somewhat clear statements: The number of people who can survive on six hours of sleep without impairment is zero.

The problem is this: That your subjective sense of how well you’re doing without sufficient sleep is a miserable predictor of objectively how well you’re doing. In other words: You don’t know that you’re sleep-deprived, even if you’re sleep deprived. It’s like with a drunk driver — ‘I know that you think you’re fine to drive, but objectively you’re not fine to drive.’

Survive is not the word you want to be using in life. Those people who say ‘I’m just fine on five to six hours of sleep’ — you may think that but unfortunately, that’s objectively, scientifically not true. And if you fight biology in that way, biology usually wins. And the way you know you’ve lost that battle is sickness and disease.



There are also five things people can do to improve their sleep, not unique to any one condition — anyone can do them. They are principles I adhere to as well.

Regularity: Go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time, whether it’s a weekday or weekend, or you’ve had a good or bad night of sleep.
Darkness: We are a dark-deprived society — we need darkness to release a hormone called melatonin, which helps the onset of your sleep. Try to limit screen time, turn down the lights in your house — you don’t need half of them on in the hour before bed. You’ll start feeling sleepier as a consequence.
Temperature: We evolved to use the drop in temperature at night to help instruct our sleep. Your core body temperature has to drop two to three degrees Fahrenheit. A cold room is moving you in right temperature direction for good healthy sleep. When we came into the modern era, we actually dislocated ourselves from the beautiful thermal ebb and flow of our environment.
Don’t sit in bed awake: Many people make this mistake. Your brain is an incredibly associative device and quickly learns that being in bed means being awake. After 20 minutes, get up, go to the other room, and under a dim light, read a book. Only return to bed when you’re sleepy. You’ll relearn the association of your bed being about sleep.
Caffeine: No caffeine after about 2 p.m. and don’t go in with a nightcap — no alcohol. Caffeine we all know keeps us awake. It’s the most traded commodity after oil, which tells us everything about our state of sleep deprivation. The danger there is even if you fall asleep and stay asleep, the depth of sleep you have isn’t going to be as deep as if you hadn’t had that cup of coffee. Now you’re reaching for two cups instead of one, developing a dependency, an addiction cycle. Alcohol is probably the most misunderstood drug when it comes to sleep. It’s a sedative, and sedation is not sleep, you’re not putting yourself in a naturalistic sleep. It will fragment your sleep, and you’ll wake up many times at night and feel unrefreshed the following day.












Sleep 7+ hours

“Treat yourself as well as you treat your smartphone, making sure to sleep until fully recharged.” — Arianna Huffington

According to research done by The National Sleep Foundation, getting a healthy amount of sleep is linked to:

increased memory;
longer life;
decreased inflammation;
increased creativity;
increased attention and focus;
decreased fat and increased muscle mass with exercise;
lower stress;
decreased dependence on stimulants like caffeine;
decreased risk of getting into accidents;
decreased risk of depression
If you sleep well and treat your body right, you won’t need caffeine and other stimulants.



In today’s frantic, hectic world, where there are only so many hours in a day to get it all done, sleep is often the thing that we sacrifice.

And there’s a certain badge of honor that comes with sleeping less. It’s the, “I’ll sleep when I’m dead mentality.”

Yet this mentality ends up hurting you far more than it helps.

Whether you’re a stressed-out college student cramming for finals, a driven professional facing a deadline, or a young working parent struggling to hold it all together, the quantity and quality of the sleep you get is crucial to your productivity and sanity.

It’s a Catch-22. You feel like you need to sleep less to get it all done, but by sleeping less you actually make yourself less productive.

We all do it, and we know it. We burn the proverbial candle at both ends, sacrificing sleep and making up for it with caffeine and power naps.

We’ve long heard that the body needs about 8 hours of sleep per night. And while the clock may say you’re getting that much, your body may be saying something else. Your sleep is fitful and interrupted, and you wake up already needing a nap.


Memory Consolidation
One critical process that happens in the brain during sleep is known as memory consolidation. During the day, our brains acquire an enormous amount of new information which needs to be processed, organized, remembered, etc.

Consolidation refers to the process where memories become stable, moving from short-term memories to long-term. It’s believed that this process happens during sleep.

It’s safe to say then, that if you’re not getting a good night sleep, this process of consolidation can be disrupted, causing memory lapses and cognitive impairment. 

Problems with recall can, to state the obvious, diminish both productivity and performance. That student cramming for finals into the wee hours of the night is probably inadvertently doing more harm than good.

Waste Removal
In addition to cataloging memories during sleep, the brain is also busy dumping waste. A recent study demonstrated that the brain’s system of waste removal is surprisingly active during sleep.

The glymphatic system clears toxins from the brain which can be responsible for Alzheimer’s disease and other devastating neurological disorders. During sleep, the brain is busy cleaning house. Providing it ample, optimal time to do this dirty work might be key to our long-term neurological health.

And it’s not just the brain that needs sleep to maintain optimal health. The rest of your body can be affected negatively by a lack of quality sleep as well. Research has linked a lack of sleep to a host of serious diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

It’s no surprise then that poor sleep quality is associated with a lower life expectancy. While a lack of sleep may not cause these health issues, it is an important factor to consider.

Turns out that the 8-hour number is actually a scientifically proven baseline that we should all strive for.

Numerous studies have proven that people who consistently get 7-8 hours of sleep a night have better attention spans and cognitive ability than those who do not. In fact, over a two-week study, people who slept only 6 hours a night showed significant cognitive impairment on par with someone who had been sleep-deprived for 24-hours. In fact, they were compared cognitively to a person who was legally drunk.

Put another way, if you’re trying to power through on only 6 hours of sleep, you might as well be drinking a few beers before you show up to work. You certainly won’t be able to perform like you should.

Consistently getting around 8 hours of quality sleep where your brain can clear toxins, store memories, and reset itself for the next day is critical to good health and optimal cognitive performance.






I’ll bet you’re not getting enough sleep. Honestly, I’m kind of cheating — it’s a pretty safe bet.

From Why We Sleep:


Two-thirds of adults throughout all developed nations fail to obtain the recommended eight hours of nightly sleep.


And that’s bad. Really bad … Yes, this is the part where I lecture you on how horrific missing sleep is. I promise to make it as quick and terrifying as possible, okay?

We often think of sleep as a passive, inactive time when our body is simply powering down and resting. While it may seem that way from the outside, sleep is actually an incredibly active time where our body, specifically the brain, is performing critical functions that allow us to wake up refreshed and ready for another day.
In fact, research has demonstrated that the energy used by the brain doesn’t decrease during sleep. So what exactly is the brain up to during that time?




From Why We Sleep:


Routinely sleeping less than six or seven hours a night demolishes your immune system, more than doubling your risk of cancer. Insufficient sleep is a key lifestyle factor determining whether or not you will develop Alzheimer’s disease. Inadequate sleep—even moderate reductions for just one week—disrupts blood sugar levels so profoundly that you would be classified as pre-diabetic. Short sleeping increases the likelihood of your coronary arteries becoming blocked and brittle, setting you on a path toward cardiovascular disease, stroke, and congestive heart failure. Fitting Charlotte Brontë’s prophetic wisdom that “a ruffled mind makes a restless pillow,” sleep disruption further contributes to all major psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, and suicidality.


So if you’re fond of saying, “I’ll sleep when I’m dead”, well, that may be happening a lot faster than you anticipated.

But I know: you’re fine. You don’t feel tired. Or you’ve “taught” yourself to get by on less sleep. Or you have mutant powers. Nope. Truth is you’re too tired to realize how tired you are. You’re like a drunk shouting, “GIMME THE KEYS! I CAN DRIVE! I’M FINE!”

From Why We Sleep:


When participants were asked about their subjective sense of how impaired they were, they consistently underestimated their degree of performance disability.


Which is probably why “ … vehicular accidents caused by drowsy driving exceed those caused by alcohol and drugs combined.”

You need eight hours. The National Sleep Foundation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both recommend 7 to 9 hours — but after 10 days of 7 hours your brain is mush whether you realize it or not. So get 8.


Let’s not forget: sleep deprivation is routinely used as a torture method. And we do this to ourselves. Voluntarily. (I’ve moved on to waterboarding myself. I like a challenge.)


On the surface, from an evolutionary perspective, sleep makes absolutely zero sense. You can’t gather food, find a mate, socialize or do anything useful while you’re out cold. And you’re vulnerable to predators.

Yet every animal that has a lifespan of more than a few days sleeps or performs a sleep-like activity. So obviously something pretty darn important is going on. Actually, a lot of important stuff …

Sleep is essential for memory and skill development. Cheat yourself on zzz’s and learning drops as much as 40%. Yeah, thats the difference between an A+ and an F.





What are the benefits of getting enough sleep?

Poor sleep can make you get ill more easily
1) Sleep boosts immunity: If you seem to catch every cold and flu bug which is going around, your bedtime could be to blame. Prolonged lack of sleep can disrupt your immune system, so you're less able to fend off bugs.

2) Sleep can slim you: Sleeping less may mean you put on weight. Studies have shown that people who sleep less than seven hours a day tend to gain more weight and have a higher risk of becoming obese than those who get seven hours of slumber. It's believed to be because sleep-deprived people have reduced levels of leptin (the chemical that makes you feel full) and increased levels of ghrelin (the hunger-stimulating hormone).

3) Sleep boosts mental wellbeing: Given that a single sleepless night can make you irritable and moody the following day, it's not surprising that chronic sleep debt may lead to long-term mood disorders like depression and anxiety. When people with anxiety or depression were surveyed to calculate their sleeping habits, it turned out that most of them slept for less than six hours a night.

4) Sleep prevents diabetes: Studies have suggested that people who usually sleep less than five hours a night have an increased risk of having or developing diabetes. It seems that missing out on deep sleep may lead to type 2 diabetes by changing the way the body processes glucose – the high-energy carbohydrate that cells use for fuel.

5) Sleep increases sex drive: Men and women who don't get enough quality sleep have lower libidos and less of an interest in sex, research shows. Men who suffer from sleep apnoea – a disorder in which breathing difficulties lead to interrupted sleep – also tend to have lower testosterone levels, which can lower libido.

6) Sleep wards off heart disease: Long-standing sleep deprivation seems to be associated with increased heart rate, an increase in blood pressure and higher levels of certain chemicals linked with inflammation, which may put extra strain on your heart.

7) Sleep increases fertility: Difficulty conceiving a baby has been claimed as one of the effects of sleep deprivation, in both men and women. Apparently, regular sleep disruptions can cause trouble conceiving by reducing the secretion of reproductive hormones.


What happens if I don't sleep?
Everyone's experienced the fatigue, short temper and lack of focus which often follow a poor night's sleep.

An occasional night without sleep makes you feel tired and irritable the next day - but it won't harm your health.

After several sleepless nights, the mental effects become more serious. Your brain will fog, making it difficult to concentrate and make decisions. You’ll start to feel down - and may fall asleep during the day. Your risk of injury and accidents at home, work and on the road also increases.

If it continues, lack of sleep can affect your overall health and make you prone to serious medical conditions, such as obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes.




Why You Should Be Tracking Your Sleep
One in three adults doesn’t get enough sleep, according to the Centers for Disease Control. And anecdotally, even that feels like a low estimate. Almost everyone I know will admit to wanting more shut-eye if the topic arises.

We all want more sleep because we know that it’s important to our health and well being. Consistently good sleep improves brain function, reduces chronic pain, gives you more energy, improves your mood, and makes you less likely to get sick. If you could bottle and sell the benefits of a good night’s rest, you’d be a very wealthy person.





In our 24/7 culture, sleep loss is a major problem. Back in 1942, we averaged almost 8 hours of sleep a night — now that’s down to 6.8. (Seven to 9 hours per night are what’s generally recommended.)

Almost 40% of Americans get less than 7 hours of sleep a night, a recent Gallup poll found, and an estimated 70 million Americans have a sleep disorder. 

Everyone knows that it’s important to get enough sleep — but you may not realize just how many things can go wrong when you don’t.

Here are 25 unfortunate risks of partial and total sleep deprivation, some more common than others.


1. Get A Healthy 7+ Hours of Sleep
Let’s face it — Sleep is just as important as eating and drinking water. Despite this, millions of people do not sleep enough and experience insane problems as a result.

The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) conducted surveys revealing that at least 40 million Americans suffer from over 70 different sleep disorders. Not only that, 60 percent of adults, and 69 percent of children, experience one or more sleep problems a few nights or more during a week.

In addition, more than 40 percent of adults experience daytime sleepiness severe enough to interfere with their daily activities at least a few days each month — with 20 percent reporting problem sleepiness a few days a week or more.

On the flip side, getting a healthy amount of sleep is linked to:

Increased memory
Longer life
Decreased inflammation
Increased creativity
Increased attention and focus
Decreased fat and increased muscle mass with exercise
Lower stress
Decreased dependence on stimulants like caffeine
Decreased risk of getting into accidents
Decreased risk of depression
And tons more… google it.
The rest of this blog post is worthless if you don’t make sleep a priority. Who cares if you wake up at 5 o’clock A.M. if you went to bed three hours earlier?

You won’t last long.

You may use stimulants to compensate, but that isn’t sustainable. In the long-run, your health will fall apart. The goal needs to be long-term sustainability.
