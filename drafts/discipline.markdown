You can't improve what you don't measure

Most people aren’t disciplined. They can’t say they consistently sit down and do the thing they should be doing.

Of course, just about everyone wants to be disciplined. But for some reason, they just can’t seem to be consistent. Maybe they can start strong and do really good at the beginning…but in the end, their energy dies a slow but sure death.

We’ve all heard stories of great self-discipline and immense self-control. These stories usually involve famous people, tech founders, or professional athletes, who accomplished the impossible and somehow worked hard enough for long enough and eventually signed the $100 million dollar contract.

But most people think that, frankly, those kind people have superpowers. They think those people have something we don’t. They were born with something the rest of us just don’t have. No matter what you do, you just can’t get yourself to do what you need to do. So why bother?

I’m here to tell you: this mindset is garbage. It’s the main reason why most people will remain in mediocrity when they could have complete financial freedom to travel the world, spend time with their family, and be their own boss.

This was me. For 4.5 years, I tried to be a consistent, disciplined writer. I’d watch Gladiator or Braveheart and get real motivated, then crank out some of the most heartfelt articles I could possibly write. But upon seeing that no one read my stuff, I’d give up and quit for months at a time.

I finally decided to become consistent. I started posting every single day. I got more views. I got picked up by some small publications. I built momentum. Bought an online writing course. Built more momentum. Wrote my first “viral” article. Got more disciplined. A year later, I’ve gained:

Most people rely on some form of “vowing” to be disciplined. “I will write 3 blog posts this week. I will go to the gym on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. I won’t spend more than $50 on restaurants this week.”

But in almost every case, this is just another way to try and make yourself “feel better,” nothing more. A common behavior of an addict who constantly relapses is intense, grand vows to change after relapsing. Of course, this rarely works — it just gives the addict something to cling to to avoid the shame and real work of making a plan.

Here’s the thing: “you” are tired. “You” will be exhausted, sleepy, and hangry (that’s hungry+angry) when you get home after a long day. The odds of consistently doing what you need to do in this state will be slim.

That’s why you need to take yourself out of the equation. You are fallible; rules are not. Set up good rules, and pretty soon they’ll begin assuring success.

Best-selling author David Kadavy discusses this very problem in his book, The Heart to Start. “When you build a habit, you don’t have to spend mental energy deciding what to do,” he writes. When you design an environment to produce success, you remove all the energy-wasting dilemmas of “Should I go to the gym, or stay home?” You just go to the gym, because that’s what you do.

This is how I finally got “sober” from a 15-year addiction to pornography. I went to counseling, therapy, and support groups. I started following a plan with specific rules: no internet after 9pm. No internet use alone in my room. Make a phone call every day and check in with a friend. No more useless vows — I took myself out of my failing promises and started following a plan.

Pretty soon, I caught on and just started following the rules. I removed myself — my tired, exhausted, cranky self — and lived by the rules.


In Conclusion
Extraordinary people don’t “manage time.” They make time. They don’t “manage money” or “save money,” they make money. They appear to have superpowers, making deals and accomplishing goals most people would tell you are impossible.

How are you going to do what you’ve never done before: be consistently self-disciplined?

By doing things you’ve never done.

You can have whatever you want if you do whatever it takes. Every level of success starts with discipline; as Navy SEAL Jocko Willink wrote, “Discipline Equals Freedom.”

Take yourself and your laziness out of the equation. Forget the vows; make a plan, and commit to it.

Start developing an upper-class mindset. Do the things successful people do. Success isn’t complicated; the fundamentals are simple.

The road to developing discipline isn’t easy. Few will stay committed long enough to see the end of the road. But once you commit to discipline, you’ll look like you have superpowers; the people in your life will marvel at your results.




Take Advantage Of Complacency
The biggest thing you must guard against during good times is complacency.

Complacency is why our bellies get bigger the older we get. Nobody has time to work out when it’s steak dinners and caviar every night.

Complacency is why some people get financially destroyed during a recession. They weren’t staying on top of their finances because they thought the good times would last forever.

Complacency is why bad apples are able to join great companies. Hiring managers didn’t bother to screen their candidates like the CIA because they’re either desperate for labor or they think their product is so good that people don’t matter as much.

Complacency is why some folks wake up 10 years from now depressed that their lives are still the same. They just assumed someone would save them.

Be very careful about letting a bull market lull you into a state of inactivity. Let the big companies with their multi-billion dollar balance sheets stop innovating. Let empire builders try and digest their rivals at record high valuations.

The second best time to start a business is when times are good. Capital is plentiful and the propensity for consumers to spend is at its highest. Just look at on-demand scooter businesses that have become billion dollar companies overnight. Set aside at least an hour every week to brainstorm. Work on your business or side hustle before or after work.

You don’t have to have everything ready to go. Just come with an imperfect product and keep iterating. If the downturn ever hits, you’ll be so far ahead of the competition.







Use meta-rules to minimize the chance of making bad choices ...

A meta-rule is a guideline you set in advance that covers all situations. The authors say they borrowed the term from Dan Ariely, a behavioral economist at Duke University.

An example of a meta-rule is "Unless it's a special occasion, I never have seconds," or "During the week, I always have salad for lunch."

The idea behind meta-rules is that you're eliminating as much choice as possible.

"The more times you present yourself with a choice, the more possibility there is to do something that you're trying not to do," Payne said.

Using meta-rules is also less mentally exhausting. Payne says that if you're trying to lose weight, it's best to just not have whatever you're trying to avoid eating in your home. Otherwise, you'll have to make a decision every night about whether to indulge.

Barnett and Payne are hardly the only people to minimize decision-making to achieve a health goal.

Max Levchin, a PayPal founder who's now the CEO of the online lending service Affirm, previously told Business Insider's Alyson Shontell about the importance of consistency in his fitness regimen.

"So long as your daily default is 'Be on the bike,' some days you'll miss because you're traveling or you're sick," he said. "But most of the time, you'll just get up, and get on a bike first thing in the morning, which is what I do."


Stick with a boring diet

"A boring diet is a slimming diet," Barnett said.

It goes back to the concept of diminishing returns.

To use Barnett's example: If you eat a single Oreo, you're going to enjoy it — but "if you eat a full bag of Oreos, by the time you eat the last one, you're not going to get nearly as much happiness or utility out of it."

He added: "If you restrict your food choices day in and day out, no matter what kind of preferences you have for food, you're going to get bored with it."

Both Barnett and Payne said they eat a salad for lunch every weekday.

"I've gotten to like salads over the years, but I don't have the urge to overeat a salad," Payne said.

When Payne goes to Starbucks, he orders an Americano with a dash of nonfat milk.

What's more, when you do allow yourself to splurge, depending on your specific meta-rules, you'll enjoy it that much more.

Weigh yourself every day to keep the numerical goal in mind

This weight-loss strategy is more controversial than the others. But the authors say it has worked for them.

A 2015 study published in the Journal of Obesity found that overweight men who weighed themselves every day and received visual feedback about their weight trajectories lost more weight than their counterparts who didn't weigh themselves as frequently, and that they were better able to maintain the weight loss.

And a study published in 2016 in the International Journal of Obesity yielded similar findings in women.

Other experts advise against weighing yourself every day. Moran Cerf, a professor of business and neuroscience at Northwestern University who has been studying decision-making for over a decade, told Business Insider's Chris Weller that people should weigh themselves just once a week.

One dietitian told USA Today she didn't recommend daily weigh-ins for most clients.

"You can get lost in those numbers and start to identify your self-worth with what's on the scale," she said.




Willpower is garbage. It doesn’t work. Your environment is more powerful than your internal resolve. Recent research by Angela Duckworth showsthat “situational self-control” is a far more effective approach than previous notions of self-control. Put most simply, you are the product of your environment.


What happened next shocked Mischel and the rest of the academic world. Kids who delayed gratification in nursery school went on to enjoy happier, healthier, and more successful adult lives. Kids with willpower were more prone to later success, because they built the habit of crowding out temptation to remain laser-focused on their goals.

Indeed, self-control seems to be a key factor in determining academic achievement.

But the bigger payoff of running ultramarathons has been at the office and at home. By strengthening my body and mind, I’ve been able to accomplish more at work and become a better husband and father. Succeeding at relationships and at work also requires self-control. Self-control can help you override undesirable urges, like snapping at your partner or putting off a big project. And the good news is that strengthening self-control in one area of your life can improve other components of life. It’s the gift of self-control spillover.






Discipline
Life is much like going to the gym. The most painful part is deciding to go. Once you get past that, it’s easy. There have been many days I have dreaded going to the gym, but once I am there and in motion, it is a pleasure. After the workout is over, I am always glad I talked myself into going.


Here's the thing. Long-term goals invariably come with doing some tasks repeatedly, whether it's hitting the gym or tracking your daily expenditure. It's boring. It becomes mechanical to a point where you say, "One miss won't hurt." Your mind tricks you into that cheat. And there's no trick to make this easy in the long term, like tying that routine to a reward. The thing you need to do, James Clear writes, is figure out a process that you truly love doing for the sake of the process alone:

But if you look at the people who are consistently achieving their goals, you start to realize that it's not the events or the results that make them different. It's their commitment to the process. They fall in love with the daily practice, not the individual event.

Fall in love with boredom. Fall in love with repetition and practice. Fall in love with the process of what you do and let the results take care of themselves.

If you are anything like me, you've started more things than you have finished. 

We're innately curious about the things around us and inspired when we come across people who have mastered their trade. We see people create cool and beautiful things and think, "Man, that looks easy, if I put in a little time I can do that in no time." What follows is a few days or weeks of focused and dedicated learning. During this time we make some progress, but not much. In fact, the progress that we do make only gets us to a point where we can truly begin to understand the complexities of the task we are undertaking. Things that look so easy as an outsider begin to take on odes of complexity that we never knew existed. We realize that this is actually going to take work to accomplish! It's at this stage that we usually lose interest  and let ourselves get lost in the gap between where we are and where we want to be. Soon after, we stop finding time for our new project and almost forget we ever started.

Fast-forward 1 or 2 years and we realize that if we had simply stuck with it and continued working, we would be that guy that inspired us in the first place! The 2 years that seemed like an eternity when we were just starting out feels - in hindsight - like a small moment in time. Why not just stick with it in the first place? If only it were that easy... 

I think this happens to a lot of people - actually, I think it happens to most people.  I've had this experience with learning instruments, blogging, carpentry, coding, and a host of other things. The main obstacle to following through on projects like these is discipline. Having the discipline to sit down and practice while you could be doing things that come natural and are easy is difficult. Its hard to justify the tradeoff because - as is the case with any skill worth having - the payoff isn't immediate.

In order to make something great, you usually have to make a lot of bad things first. And while everyone wants to make awesome things, few have the patience and persistence to slog through the necessity of first making the awful things.

Everyone has had one those moments mid-workout where you just want to throw in the towel and quit. 

To put it bluntly, goals are for losers. That’s literally true most of the time. For example, if your goal is to lose 10 pounds, you will spend every moment until you reach the goal—if you reach it at all—feeling as if you were short of your goal. In other words, goal-oriented people exist in a state of nearly continuous failure that they hope will be temporary.

If you achieve your goal, you celebrate and feel terrific, but only until you realize that you just lost the thing that gave you purpose and direction. Your options are to feel empty and useless, perhaps enjoying the spoils of your success until they bore you, or to set new goals and re-enter the cycle of permanent presuccess failure.
