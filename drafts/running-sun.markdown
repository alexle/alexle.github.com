Keep to the shadows, stay in the shade!
When youâ€™re bone-pale and pasty, you have a love-hate relationship with summer. You either have to keep to the shade at all times, making strategic dashes from one dappled area to the next, or you have to dip yourself in a vat of sunscreen.
Going for a jog around the block also becomes an exercise in strategy: which area affords the most shade? Should you get up at 6am to avoid the sun? Or should you cover every inch of skin?

Nasty sun.
