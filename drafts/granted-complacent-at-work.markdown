My career has apparently come full circle. Years ago I was a Gen-Xer, trim and clean shaven, sporting Jerry Garcia ties and buffed loafers. I always said “yes” and delivered more than was expected. For that, my older peers resented me. Maybe I was a naive go-getter. But I was also a reminder that they had grown slow, sloppy, and satisfied. Back then, the veterans would whisper how management was hiring youngsters like me to push them out. I was the competition—a threat, even—and they stepped up their game in response.

It’s funny how little changes between generations. These rookies have earned a tryout, just as I had at their age. And their performance makes me squirm. Their work reminds me of the basics I’ve taken for granted over the years. It reinforces that I’m replaceable someday. And it motivates me to suck in my gut and earn my keep every day. Sure, my network, institutional knowledge, and track record open doors. But these new hires are so young, spirited, and full of possibility.

But we have too much invested to walk away. And that’s where these rookies have us beat. This opportunity is their shot. After having their talents wasted for so long, they’re going after what we’ve taken for granted, with a hunger to earn a big paycheck and make a difference. So they come in like a ball of energy, networking with everyone, closing deals, and tackling the problems we’d given up on fixing long ago. They understand that they need to go big and bold, to be fearless and stay on the offensive, knowing they can only make it if they do what others are no longer willing or able to do.

The rookies are somehow able to boil the job down to the basics: They focus on the customer and the task.

7. What got you to level one won’t get you to level two

In the beginning of your career, your technical skills matter the most.

You get tested on how well you can use excel, or write code, or design products, etc.

But as time goes on, those technical skills start to matter less. How you interact with people starts to matter a lot more.

Most people think that if they just get good enough at their craft, then everything will be fine.

And it’s true, being good at what you do does matter.

But you need much more than that. You need to know how to navigate the world of office politics. You need to figure out how to add value outside of your role.

You need to figure out what your company needs, and give it to them — even if they don’t tell you what it is.
