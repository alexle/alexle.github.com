Do you ever get upset about the nasty behavior of your co-workers, friends, or even family? Well, if you let others upset you, it’s not their fault.

“It’s not me, it’s him!” is what most of us say. We’re always quick to blame others for how we feel.

We say that others make us feel that way. But that’s false. You decide how you feel about the things that happen in your life.

Events can’t harm us. Our perception of an event harms us. That’s one of the most important ideas of Stoic philosophy.

In other words, you decide what meaning you give to the things that happen in your life. If your friend tells lies about you behind your back, and you get upset, that’s because you decided to get upset.

After all, you don’t control others. That’s why who you spend your time with is a matter of life and death.




Negative visualization.

This concept comes from Stoic philosophy and it is insanely powerful. The idea is this: take a moment to imagine you have lost everything. Go as extreme as possible. Imagine your house has burnt down, you have lost all your money, your family is dead, the industry you work in has been eliminated by AI, civilization has fallen, whatever. Imagine how it would feel. Shut your eyes and feel the despair, the pain, the fear. Sit with the feeling for a while. Then open your eyes and remind yourself that none of it has happened.

It sounds pessimistic, but it is a very optimistic concept. As the old saying goes, you never miss your water until the well runs dry. By using negative visualization, it is possible to miss the water without the well actually running dry. Simulating rock bottom makes the current situation seem hopeful. Life can always get worse!

I first discovered this concept long before I had even heard of Stoicism. I was about 10 and I remember writing in my journal: ‘treasure every moment, there’s always something left to lose.’ I was in a miserable place when I wrote that. The girl I hung out with every day at school ditched me for someone else. My brother moved out. My cat had to be put up for adoption after a feral tom started attacking her. Somehow, that wisdom which was rather mature for my age spilled out. I reminded myself again and again that I still had so much. Years later I discovered Stoicism and that there was a name for it. Stoicism is a unique philosophy because it is practical, designed for use, not study.

I still use negative visualization on a regular basis as a means of finding positivity. Nightmares also seem to serve as an unconscious form of it too. If you have ever woken up in a cold sweat after dreaming of something appalling happening, shaking with gratitude at the realization that it wasn’t real, you know how powerful this is. Turning it into an intentional process has dramatic effects.





Brown says “everything worthwhile in your life draws its meaning from the fact you will die.” The Stoics use the Latin phrase “memento mori” as their reminder of mortality.

Get comfortable with the idea that one day you and everyone you know won’t be here. Let that dictate your every moment. Find happiness in the absurdity that we’re all taking ourselves so seriously when really it doesn’t even matter. The hit musical Wicked describes it best in their song Dancing Through Life, with the lyrics “nothing matters, but knowing nothing matters”. That person who slagged you off behind your back? Who cares?! That competitor who copies everything you do. So what?! Good luck to them all. You hope they make it. It’s not a zero sum game and thinking it is ignores the real heart of the matter - you’re not going to live forever.

Find freedom in the fact that whatever happens, one day you’ll be gone, so you might as well be happy today while you are alive. Your problems really aren’t that big.



Don’t take it personally
In Confessions of a Conjuror, Derren Brown writes: "Each of us is leading a difficult life, and when we meet people we are seeing only a tiny part of the thinnest veneer of their complex, troubled existences. To practise anything other than kindness towards them, to treat them in any way save generously, is to quietly deny their humanity."

It would be easy to let the actions of others dictate your happiness, but what would this achieve? If you receive an email you perceive to be unfriendly, or someone cuts you up, or doesn’t let you out, it’s not personal. That person might have just lost a family member, they might be dealing with problems far worse than ours. They probably didn’t mean it to upset you. Seeing other people and their actions as being out to get you is the sure fire route to unhappiness, because in reality it’s probably nothing to do with you.










Without further ado, I present 5 ways to make Stoicism a daily practice:

1. Visualize Your Life Without the Things You Love

For example, if you live in a tornado-prone region, imagine your house being destroyed, along with all your possessions. Obviously sort of a sad thought experiment, but chances are good that you’ll actually come to better appreciate your home, and the stuff in it, if you can really visualize what life might be like without it.

When I drive to daycare in the afternoon to pick up my son, I briefly meditate on the fact that each day really is a gift, and that anything can happen. He might not be around tomorrow, so I better live and love and parent to my fullest, most joyful abilities today.

I know the odds are extremely slim of that reality. It’s more an acknowledgment that you just never know when the things and people you love might not be there anymore. It’s truly made a difference in my mindset, general gratitude, and mostly — as perhaps to be expected in this young kids phase — my patience. Whether my toddler son is taking forever to brush his teeth, or my 1-month-old daughter decides she won’t sleep unless she’s held and rocked, I seem better able to cope when I briefly imagine a life without them. It should also be noted that this exercise hasn’t made me sad or mopey as you might expect; rather, it makes me swell with gratitude for the days we are given, and I can say that I better truly appreciate all the blessings life has to offer, from my wife and kids, to the cheerful song of a bird out my window on a nice spring day.

3. Set Internal Goals and Detach Yourself From Outcomes

Recognizing that much of life is out of your control doesn’t mean giving up your sense of agency; instead, it means focusing it on the only areas where you do have full control: your own actions.

Instead of focusing on results — which are impacted by external circumstances outside your control — set goals strictly related to your own efforts. Instead of setting a goal to win the match, make it a goal to prepare as best you can, practice as hard as you can, and then play to the best of your abilities. If you do those things, and still lose, there’s just nothing more you could have done, so why fret?

Rather than setting a goal of getting the job you’re interviewing for, make it your goal to prepare well, dress right, and answer every question as best you can. If you do all that and don’t get the job, it wasn’t meant to be (or so the Stoics would argue).

Rather than setting a goal of getting a girlfriend, prioritize making yourself a good catch. Eat well, work out, have a stable job, dress nicely, and make it a goal to ask someone out X times a month until you get a yes.




Do you want to win that tennis match? It is outside of your control. But to play the best game you can is under your control. Do you want your partner to love you? It is outside of your control. But there are plenty of ways you can choose to show your love to your partner—and that is under your control. Do you want a particular political party to win the election? It is outside of your control (unless you’re Vladimir Putin). But you can choose to engage in political activism, and you can vote. These aspects of your life are under your control. If you succeed in shifting your goals internally, you will never blame or criticize anyone, and you won’t have a single rival, because what other people do is largely beyond your control and therefore not something to get worked up about. The result will be an attitude of equanimity toward life’s ups and downs, leading to a more serene life.


4. welcome discomfort

To be Epicurean — one who basically just seeks the things in life that feel the best — you have to ever be experiencing pleasure. You’re basically living off constant dopamine hits. But, those senses get dulled after a while, and you need ever bigger and more pervasive doses to keep your pleasure sensors activated at the same level. Once you start running on the “hedonic treadmill,” real contentedness becomes frustratingly elusive.

Let’s show this with a quick little thought exercise. It’s simple: you want to stay cool when it’s hot outside. It’s a natural inclination. So you turn on the AC at home to a chilly 65 degrees while it’s a sizzlingly 95 outside. Ahhh, feels nice, doesn’t it? You get used to that sense of comfort, and even pleasure of staying so cool. But now, to feel comfortable, you also need to feel that cool wherever you go. You need to start your car 10 minutes early so that it cools down enough for you to be comfortable, otherwise you’ll just be miserable. You need your workplace, your favorite restaurant, heck, every establishment you enter, to be that chilled. If, God forbid, the AC goes out, you’re royally screwed. A friend invites you to an outdoor ball game? You’ll go, but you won’t enjoy it because it’ll be too stinkin’ hot. It’s all you’ll be able to focus on.

Consider the alternate scenario. Yes, you turn on the AC at home, but in the car, you just roll the windows down and let yourself be a little warm if it’s hot outside. Rather than work out in your refrigerator of a basement, you take a ruck outside in order to break a sweat. In some regards, you embrace being hot every now and then so that you can feel content in any situation. AC goes out? No biggie, you can adjust. Invited to a ball game in a heat wave? Heck yes! You love baseball, and you’re happy to just be at the game, regardless of the weather. You are a tranquil man who isn’t bothered merely by what the mercury reads on the thermometer.

Isn’t that a better way to live?

Irvine lays out three specific benefits of sometimes welcoming discomfort and intentionally foregoing pleasures (with an example of how a particular practice — periodically abstaining from alcohol — could play out):

It hardens us to whatever misfortunes may come in the future. (If your health turns, and the doctor forbids you imbibing alcohol, having practiced regular periods of sobriety will help you to easily get through that period.)
The idea of those misfortunes won’t cause us anxiety, because we know we can withstand and even be content in just about any scenario. (You can look forward to a birthday party with friends where you know the booze will be flowing; you won’t be downtrodden about not being able to have any fun, because you know you can enjoy things just fine without alcohol.)
It helps us appreciate the pleasures we do have, when we have them. (If you then receive a clean bill of health, you’ll be far more appreciative of the dram of whiskey you can enjoy with friends.)





This week’s selection comes from Marcus Aurelius and his Meditations. He recommends you focus not on the past or future, but the present alone:

“Do not let the panorama of your life oppress you, do not dwell on all the various troubles which may have occurred in the past or may occur in the future. Just ask yourself in each instance of the present: ‘What is there in this work which I cannot endure or support?’ You will be ashamed to make any such confession. Then remind yourself that it is neither the future nor the past which weighs on you, but always the present—and the present burden reduces...”

What It Means
Don’t let the grand scope of your life hold you back. Don’t focus on the hardships of your past, and don’t stress about what might go wrong in the future. Stay focused on right now. Is there something about this very moment or this particular task that you can’t handle? Probably not, because you know you can get through it. Remember, it’s not the weight of the future or the weight of the past that you should be carrying. Let those burdens fall away, and the weight of the present becomes much lighter.

What to Take From It
We tend to focus on where we’ve been and where we’re going, but we don’t put enough thought into the present. But all that really matters is now because that’s all there is. The past is only memories, writings, or recordings, and the future merely conjecture based on those things. You are never in the past or in the future, so why waste so much of your time and energy there?

When life gets tough, or you’re struggling through some difficult work, remember to stop and let go of useless burdens, like the past (it’s unchangeable), and the future (it’s unforeseeable). Don’t dwell on your entire life, or a certain span of it, as a whole and wonder how you’ll get by. Look at this exact moment, right now. Can you get through this moment? Yes. Okay, how about this one? Of course, it’s not much different than the last. And this one? Again, yes. See, the only weight you need to carry is the present, and you’re certainly strong enough to lift that. You’ve been doing it your whole life and then some.






Why do we always take things personally?

There are quite a few viable and valid answers to the question of why we take things personally.  But the one Angel and I have found to be most common through a decade of one-on-one coaching with our course students is the tendency we all have of putting ourselves at the center, and seeing everything—every event, conversation, circumstance, etc.—from the viewpoint of how it relates to us.  And this can have all kinds of adverse effects, from feeling hurt when other people are rude, to feeling sorry for ourselves when things don’t go as planned, to doubting ourselves when we aren’t perfect.

Of course, we are not really at the center of everything.  That’s not how the world works.  It just sometimes seems that way to us.  Let’s take a quick look at a few examples…

Someone storms into the room in a bad mood, huffing and puffing, and addresses us in a very rude way.  Immediately we think to ourselves, “What’s going on here?  I don’t deserve to be treated like this.  They should know better!”  And we are left agitated, offended, and angry.  But the truth is the other person’s behavior has very little to do with us.  They got mad at something outside the room, and now they’re reactively venting their frustrations.  We just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  This reality doesn’t justify their rude behavior, but it needs to be consciously acknowledged so we don’t waste all our mental energy positioning ourselves at the center of the situation and taking everything personally.

Now, let’s assume for a moment that a person’s actions actually do seem to relate to us directly—we inadvertently did something that annoyed someone, and now they’re reacting very rudely to us.  A situation like this might seem personal, but is it really?  Is the magnitude of their rude reaction all about us and the one thing we did to trigger them?  No, probably not.  It’s mostly just a statement about the other person’s reactions, snap-judgments, anger issues, and expectations of the universe.  Again, we’re just a small piece of a much longer story.

And likewise, when someone else rejects us, ignores us, doesn’t call us when they said would, doesn’t show they care, etc. … these reactions have much less to do with us than they have to do with the other person’s history of personal issues.

But because we see everything through lens of how it affects us—a lens that does a poor job of seeing the bigger picture—we tend to react to everyone else’s actions and words as if they are a personal judgment or statement about us.  Thus, other people’s anger makes us angry.  Other people’s lack of respect makes us feel unworthy.  Other people’s unhappiness makes us unhappy.  And so it goes.

If you’re nodding your head to any of this, it’s time to…

Remind yourself of the truth!

What other people say and do, and the attitude they carry, rarely has anything to do with you.  People’s reactions and behaviors are about their perspectives, wounds and experiences.  Whether people treat you like you’re amazing, or act like you’re the worst, again, is more about them and how they are viewing the world at a given moment in time.

Now, I’m certainly not suggesting we should completely ignore all the feedback and insight we receive from others.  I’m simply saying that a significant percentage of the emotional pain, disappointment and sadness in our lives comes directly from our tendency to take things too personally.

In most cases, it’s far more beneficial and healthy to let go of other people’s beliefs and behaviors and to operate with your own intuition and wisdom as your guide.

And that takes practice.  Lots and lots of practice.

The key is in reminding yourself to gracefully deflect the senseless negativity around you.  When you sense negativity coming at you, give it a small push back with a thought like, “That remark (or gesture) is not really about me, it’s about you.”  Remember that all people have emotional issues they’re dealing with (just like you), and it makes them defiant, rude, and downright thoughtless sometimes.  They are doing the best they can, or they’re not even aware of their issues.  In any case, you can learn not to interpret their behaviors as personal attacks, and instead see them as non-personal encounters (like a dog barking in the distance, or a bumblebee buzzing by) that you can either respond to gracefully, or not respond to at all.

But again, this doesn’t come naturally—NOT taking things personally is a skill to be honed.

To help you practice, I recommend storing the following reminders in an easily accessible location (perhaps by bookmarking this article in your smart phone), and then reading (and re-reading) them whenever you catch yourself taking things personally.

Calmness is a superpower.  The ability to not overreact or take things personally keeps your mind clear and your heart at peace.
Even when it seems personal, rarely do people do things because of you, they do things because of them.
You may not be able control all the things people say and do to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.
There is a huge amount of freedom that comes to you when you detach from other people’s beliefs and behaviors.  The way people treat you is their problem, how you react is yours.  (Angel and I discuss this further in the “Self-Love” chapter of our book.)
Oftentimes people do things and say things because they’ve been conditioned to, not because they consciously want to.
You can’t control how people receive your energy.  Whatever someone interprets, or projects onto you, is at least partially an issue or problem that they themselves are dealing with.
Take constructive criticism seriously, but not personally.  Weigh what you hear from others against what you know in your heart to be true.
If you’re willing to view the behavior of other people as indicative of their relationship with themselves, then you will inevitably take things less personally.
If you truly wish to improve your self-confidence, self-esteem, and self-worth, stop allowing other people to be responsible for them.  Stop allowing other people to dominate your emotions.  (Angel and I build powerful self-confidence rituals with our students in the “Love and Relationships” module of Getting Back to Happy.)
All the hardest, coldest people you meet were once as soft as a baby.  And that’s the tragedy of living.  So when people are rude, be kind, be mindful, be your best.  Give those around you the “break” that you hope the world will give you on your own “bad day” and you will never, ever regret it.






I couldn’t control the thieves in Rome, and I couldn’t go back and change what had happened. I could, however, accept what had happened and file it away for future reference, focusing instead on having a nice time during the rest of my stay. After all, nothing tragic had happened. I thought about this. And it worked. I joined my evening company, related what happened, and proceeded to enjoy the movie, the dinner, and the conversation. My brother was amazed that I took things with such equanimity and that I was so calm about it. But that’s precisely the power of internalizing the Stoic dichotomy of control.



For example, let’s say that you are preparing your résumé for a possible job promotion. If your goal is to get the promotion, you are setting yourself up for a possible disappointment. There is no guarantee that you will get it, because the outcome is not (entirely) under your control. Sure, you can influence it, but it also depends on a number of variables that are independent of your efforts, including possible competition from other employees, or perhaps the fact that your boss, for whatever unfathomable reason, really doesn’t like you.


That’s why your goal should be internal: If you adopt the Stoic way, you would conscientiously put together the best résumé that you can, and then mentally prepare to accept whatever outcome with equanimity, knowing that sometimes the universe will favor you, and other times it will not. What do you gain by being anxious over something you don’t control? Or angry at a result that was not your doing? You are simply adding a self-inflicted injury to the situation, compromising your happiness and serenity.
