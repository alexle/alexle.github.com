I'm going to let you in on a secret technique of mine.

It's one which has helped me overcome many difficult moments in life. When I get stuck in soul-crushing traffic. When I'm burnt out at work. When the schedule calls for 18 miles and I want to quit after the second one.

All it takes is changing **ONE** word. One word to change your entire view of any situation. I came across it a couple years ago and only wish I had known about it sooner.

Let me illustrate it with a story.

## The Dreaded Bonk ##

Last summer I ran my first 50k. It was an incredible and memorable experience. But not all of it was rainbows and unicorns.

I bonked absurdly hard at Mile 22. I could barely move. I had no energy. Completely wiped out. I just wanted it to end and to lay in bed somewhere with a bag of Cheetos.

This is so terrible, I told myself. I have to keep running though. I have to keep suffering. I have to finish.

Then I laughed at how silly that sounded. Because there I was, in the middle of the freaking Rocky Mountains, experiencing Colorado in a way that very few people get to.

The weather was gorgeous. The air was remarkably fresh. I was healthy. I had a capable body. Even my siblings were waiting for me at the finish!

How many people would give anything to switch spots with me? To them, they'd probably feel this moment was a gift. Something to be appreciated. That they **get** to run this race.

And that's the secret. Once I harnessed it, my view of the race changed dramatically. It enabled me to overcome any hill and dark place I encountered to finish in [6:57][1].

## Change One Word ##

Instead of always thinking you "have" to do something, switch the word with "get".

* I get to go to the gym
* I get to do homework for college
* I get to drive to work
* I get to practice the piano
* I get to write code all day
* I get to take care of and raise my kids
* I get to see my parents each week
* I get to celebrate Valentine's day with my significant other
* I get to eat vegetables

It seems silly at first. I get to do college homework? Why would I be happy about that.

Then you realize there are people who'd love the opportunity and chance to attend college, but can't due to finances or a life situation. People who have a desperate desire to learn, but are stuck providing for their loved ones.

Suddenly, what seemed like a chore just 5 minutes ago has transformed into a **reward**! You savor solving the differential equations now. You revel in awe when you finally make sense of Fourier Transfer functions.

What a difference a word makes.

## The Power Of Gratitude ##

Sometimes, I get so caught up in the day-to-day routine that I fail to appreciate the little things. It's easy to forget how good I have it or how lucky I am.

That's why this technique has helped so much. Because it gives me the chance to be thankful for whatever I'm doing. A moment to subconsciously practice gratitude without all the journals and rituals.

As I used this technique in more situations, I slowly felt a calm and positive spirit in how I went about things. No longer did little things ruin my day as easily (I'm still human). Instead, I found myself smiling more. Feeling lighter and happier.

When you're grateful for the small things in life, your perspective changes for the better. Just eating pizza on a rooftop after a group run can feel like winning the lottery.

It's been so impactful, that sometimes I feel I've unlocked one of life's great secrets. Like I'm seeing things in a different light.

## Give It A Try ##

Life doesn't always go as planned. There will be situations I can't change. I can, however, control how I react to them. I can choose to get mad, to suffer, to complain. Or I can choose to change my perspective and enjoy it.

People often ask me what my favorite part of running is. I usually list out a bunch of reasons, depending how my runs have been.

But the simple truth is always because, "I get to".
