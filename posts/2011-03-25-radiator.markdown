5 Hour Radiator Replacement
03-25-2011

I was driving home from work the other day when I noticed my car's heat gauge slowly past the 50% mark. This odd behavior was more alarming due to the puddles of liquid seen beneath my engine recently. And to the check engine light that had been on for over 5 weeks..

Turns out my radiator had a leak. I watched a youtube video called 10 Minute Radiator Replacement (Most Cars) and thought to myself, "that doesn't look that hard.."

A couple hours later, that thought was replaced with "what were you thinking alex". I got some help from an old friend and was able to finish around the 5 hour mark. It takes most auto shops 30min to replace a radiator. My back hurts and my hands are scuffed up, but overall it was a satisfying and good learning experience.

Old radiator, sorry I did not take better care of you.



Transferring hoses from old radiator to new radiator.



Bam! The new radiator ready to go to its new home.



One last look before installation.
