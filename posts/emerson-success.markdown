meta: What is success? Maybe Ralph Waldo Emerson's perspective on success is a good guideline.
---

If someone asked me what success was, I really couldn't tell them.

Fancy job title. Big paycheck. Nice car and big house. Fame and lifestyle. That's what pops in my head when I hear the word 'success'.

But when I think about it, none of the above mean that much to me. Especially when I'm retired and looking back on my life. Is success really about what you **own** now?

It's weird how many of us work and sacrifice so much to become "successful", yet don't have a clear idea of what that entails for each of us.

Instead of blindly trying to live up to these expectations, why not stop and ask yourself:

* Why am I doing this?
* Is this what makes **me** successful?
* Does this make me happy?

I'm not sure what success means to me yet. But for the mean time, Ralph Waldo Emerson's take on success sounds pretty good to me.

> To laugh often and much..

> To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children..

> To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends..

> To appreciate beauty..

> To find the best in others..

> To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition..

> To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived..

> This is to have succeeded!

> -Ralph Waldo Emerson
