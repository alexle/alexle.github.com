1 Year. 77 Runs. 125 Miles.
12-30-2012

I set a [goal][1] to run 100 miles in 2012. At the time, I thought it was going to be a breeze. 100 miles came out to a little over 8 miles a month, or a 2 mile run every week. It seemed so easy..

Six months later, I had logged only 25 miles and was ready to throw in the towel. Sub-35 degree and windy runs were miserable. Runs over 1.25 miles were tortuous and aching. And for reasons I couldn't explain, it felt as if I was getting **worse**. More details about this later.

Fortunately, I kept with it and after much pain, sweat, and tears, I'm proud to present the final mile tally of my runs this year:

It doesn't sound very impressive, but completing this goal ranks as one of the **top-five** achievements in my life so far. Not so much for the number of miles or difficulty of the runs. But more for the [commitment][2] required to go through with it. There were so many days I just wanted to sleep in, or relax to a TV show after a long day of work. So many chances to say, "I'll just run tomorrow". And so many moments to simply **stop**.

I couldn't be happier with how well this goal played out. To say that it was a success is an understatement. Running this year has completely transformed my views on health and fitness, and combined with some [CrossFit][3] workouts, helped me become the fittest I've ever been in my life.

While I understand that running isn't for everyone, it's hard not to share and endorse something that's had such a positive impact on your life. I use to be one of those people who believed "running was [boring][5]" and "running was bad for your knees". Now, I enjoy and actually look forward to it.

As the year comes to a close, give some thought to some positive activities you dread or dislike (waking up early, making a budget, working out). With a plan and some focus, your view and life may change when all is said and done. In fact, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
