Training For A Marathon In 9 Weeks, Part II

###Week 4 - 14mi LSD###

I logged short runs of 4, 5, and 3 miles for the week. Slightly lower than Hal Higdon's plan, but hopefully it won't impact me too much. This week's LSD was my first run over 2 hours. And the first time I ever hit a "wall".

Essentially, hitting the wall is the point when your glycogen (stored energy) is depleted. Your legs turn to stone.  

\* Lesson: Fueling properly is extremely important. If you wait for your body, it's too late.

###Week 5 - 15mi LSD###

Major setback back this week with short runs of only 4, 3, and 3 miles. I have to put more effort towards them next week. As for the LSD, it was the most painful one yet. Calves, arches, hip flexors, IT band, and a bunch of other leg muscles I never knew existed were on fire. Is this what child birth feels like? It was the first time I had serious doubts about finishing the marathon.

I stuck to the plan of water at 30 minutes, GU + water at 60 minutes, and powerade fuel at 90 minutes. Next week, I'll try to GU every 45 minutes and see if that helps.

\* Lesson: When in pain, relax and focus on a couple steps at a time. And it's ok to walk.
