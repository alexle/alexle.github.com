###Week 4 - 14mi LSD###

Short runs were 4, 5, and 3 miles for the week. I'm falling slightly behind on them, but I hope it won't affect me too much. This week's LSD was my first run over 2 hours. And the first time I ever hit a "wall".

Essentially, hitting the wall is the point when your glycogen (stored energy) is depleted. Your legs turn to stone.  

\* Lesson: Fueling properly is extremely important. If you wait for your body, it's too late.

###Week 5 - 15mi LSD###

I logged disappointing short runs of 4, 3, and 3 miles this week. It's becoming to concern me, and I plan to put more effort towards them next week.
