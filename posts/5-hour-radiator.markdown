5 Hour Radiator Replacement
03-25-2011

I was driving home from work the other day when I noticed my car's heat gauge slowly past the 50% mark. This odd behavior was more alarming due to the puddles of liquid seen beneath my engine recently. And to the check engine light that had been on for over 5 weeks..

Turns out my radiator had a leak. I watched a youtube video called [10 Minute Radiator Replacement (Most Cars)][1] and thought to myself, "that doesn't look that hard.."

A couple hours later, that thought was replaced with "what were you thinking alex". I got some help from an old friend and was able to finish around the 5 hour mark. It takes most auto shops 30min to replace a radiator. My back hurts and my hands are scuffed up, but overall it was a satisfying and good learning experience.

Old radiator, sorry I did not take better care of you.

One last look before installation.
