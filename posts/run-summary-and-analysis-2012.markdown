A Summary And Analysis Of Running In 2012
01-02-2013

*WARNING: Lots of statistics and graphs below. Proceed at your own risk.*

Below is a brief summary and analysis of of all my [runs in 2012][1]. All in all, I ran **77 times** with an average distance of **1.6 miles** at an average pace of **8:16** for a total of **125.59 miles**. Runs were tracked with the Nike+ Running app on my iPhone (GPS), and only outdoor runs were recorded.

The majority of my runs were done in the Fall -- Sep, Oct, and Nov combined for a whopping 73.81 miles (59% of the year's runs)! The 40-65 degree weather was energizing, the air was brisk, and nothing beats the crunching sound of leaves beneath your feet. Definitely my favorite season to run.

On the other hand, the other 9 months added up to only 51.69 miles (41% of the year's runs). Winter runs were brutal for me; they always felt "un-optimal". Heavy layers of clothes, icy air blasting through my lungs, uncomfortable freezing of all my extremities. Going for a run was hard enough.  The extra challenges of Winter made it much harder.

I struggled with runs over a mile for a long time. My body would literally shut down, on cue, after hearing the mile beeper. Until I made **one** change that ultimately allowed my runs to reach new limits. What was that change?

*Run for distance, not time.*

In high school, we were always working to improve our mile times. So I followed suit. Run fast first, run farther later was my reasoning. However, I was so focused on beating my previous mile time that I'd be A) too exhausted to run further or B) too dejected from not hitting the time and not motivated to go on.

On a whim one day in Sep, I changed the Nike+ run setting to a "timed-run". It didn't matter how fast, it didn't matter how far. Just a challenge to run 15 minutes without stopping. The graph pretty much sums up how well that worked out for me.

Next, we have the number of runs I participated in each month. Feb was embarrassing; I think the shock of how hard running was and the cold temperatures traumatized me for a period of time. Otherwise, I'm pleased to see the increasing trend of my attempts to run. Even if they weren't the best runs, I'd like to think that just making it out on the road was something to be proud of. 90% of success is showing up, right? (Woody Allen)

The graph above shows (not to scale) the average pace of my runs each month. In Jan, I averaged 8 minutes and 51 seconds on my runs. By the end of the year, my average mile was down to 7 minutes and 56 seconds, a difference of almost a minute! The best part? My average pace **decreased**, even as the length of my runs **increased**. A good and very noticeable sign.

Running in the morning was my preferred choice. It felt great to crawl out of bed, throw on my shoes, and make a statement on the day. The neighborhoods and streets were quiet, leaving just the sounds of my steps and heavy breathing to keep me company. Night runs were appealing in the hot Summer months, while afternoon runs were favored in the Winter and Spring to maximize the warmth of the sun.

Finally, my personal records of the year. My farthest (and longest) run was **3.42 miles** at a pace of **8'46"** in **30:01**. My fastest 5k was finished in **24:49** at a pace of **7'56"**. And my fastest mile was completed on a high school track against my brother, where I ran it in **6'29"**.

In summary, recording my runs was invaluable in completing my goal to run 100 miles. It provided a way for me to track my progress, as well as provide insight on my trends and humps in my way.

As I settle more into the running groove, I plan to focus less on distance and time to incorporate different exercises such as fartleks, tempo runs, and intervals into my training. I don't know what 2013 holds for me, but I'm ready to face any challenges on the road. Bring it on!
