Hiking up a 14er is an exhilarating experience. It's been a couple days since my [memorable hike][1] and I thought I'd share what worked for me on the trip and what I would do differently next time.

1. **Start early.** Most hikers estimate one hour per 1000 feet of elevation gain. Plan accordingly because it can be dangerous on the summit if bad weather rolls in, which is common even during the summer months in Colorado. We left the summit of Torrey's at 1:20 pm and it was hailing/raining at that point. Starting earlier (before 8am) and leaving the peak no later than noon would be safer for next time.

2. **Bring plenty of water.** I consume a lot of water each day and heat up easily when doing physical activities. For the 8.4 mile RT trip up Grey's/Torrey's, I brought a 100oz CamelBak, two 16oz water bottles, and one 32oz Gatorade (for electrolytes/salt). In hindsight, that amount of liquid was overkill on that hike. 4 liters would have been sufficient, though it's better to have <u>too</u> much water than not enough in my opinion. The general rule of thumb is 1 liter of water for every 3 miles you hike.

3. **Stay hydrated.** Drinking when you're thirsty is too late (one can be a quart low on fluids before feeling thirsty), and puts yourself at risk for dehydration, fatigue, and cramps. According to [HighAltitudeLife][7], the higher up you are, the more water your body needs to keep functioning. I recommend drinking small amounts of water frequently, which is another reason why a hydration bladder is nice to have.

4. **Food needs vary from person to person.**  On the trip, our group only finished *half* the food we brought. Perhaps it was the altitude, physical exhaustion, or breakfast we had in the morning. What worked well for us was eating small amounts of trail mix, beef jerky, power bars, and [Clif Shot Bloks][4] along the way. That kept our energy levels consistently high. A small lunch on the summit was more than enough. 

5. **Prepare for ALL the elements.** Check the weather report beforehand, but all bets are off when the elevation is this high. For warm weather, stick to synthetic fabrics that wick sweat away. Sunglasses and hats offer needed protection from the sun. For rain and wind, bring a lightweight shell even if you don't think you'll need it. My Marmot DriClime Jacket kept me dry and warm when the conditions worsened unexpectedly. My friend used a poncho, but would not recommend it since it flew around in the wind and blocked his vision of where he was stepping. I'd probably bring gloves and a beanie next time.

6. **Trekking poles are worth it.** As we made our way up a steep climb, a 13 year old girl caught up to us and remarked, "I'll trade you my trail mix for your trekking poles". They may look silly to some, but they reduce fatigue, stress on knees, and are a great help when negotiating slippery terrain. It's like having 4 legs to help you balance and maneuver.

7. **Understand the route and conditions. Have a map/gps.** Plan and know your route in advance. Are the paths clear of snow? Will you have to take detours? There is a ton of information on [14ers.com][5] and [ProTrails.com][6]. I was always one to scoff at maps and didn't think they were necessary.. until I couldn't determine which path we needed to take on the way down. Luckily, my friend had a GPS map on his phone.

8. **Be safe.** A small first aid kit with bandages, tape, gauze pads, and anti-bacterial wipes can go a long way. Know the signs of [altitude sickness][2]. Rest for a few minutes if you feel lightheaded, the lightheadedness is from a lack of oxygen to your brain. Bring survival gear if you expect to be pushing the limits of a day hike. A head lamp can be invaluable in a pinch.

9. **Account for personal needs.** Everyone remembers the essentials such as sunscreen and bug spray, but don't neglect simple conveniences such as toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and extra socks. Asprin or Ibuprofen also comes in handy for minor pains and headaches.

10. **Enjoy it.** Completing a 14er is a memorable experience so take your time and "smell the roses". Many focus on just making it to the top, and don't fully appreciate the journey up. Take in the breath-taking views. Focus on the sounds of your steps and breathing as you climb a steep incline. Debate what's going to happen next in [A Game Of Thrones][3] with your friends. And enjoy some of the best air you're ever going to breathe when you're on top.

Keep in mind these tips are based on my experiences, and that each person's comfort level is different. Hopefully, this post was able to provide a sense of what one can expect on a 14er hike and how I plan to prepare for one in the future.
