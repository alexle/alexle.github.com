10 Tips For Hiking Your First 14er
07-06-2012

Hiking up a 14er is an exhilarating experience. It's been a couple days since my [memorable hike][1] and I thought I'd share what worked for me on the trip and what I would do differently next time.

1. **Start early.** Most hikers estimate one hour per 1000 feet of elevation gain. Plan accordingly because it can be dangerous on the summit if bad weather rolls in, which is common even during the summer months in Colorado. We left the summit of Torrey's at 1:20 pm and it was hailing/raining at that point. Starting earlier (perhaps 8am) and leaving the peak around noon would be safer for next time.

2. **Bring plenty of water.** I drink a <u>lot</u> of water every day and heat up easily when doing physical activities. For the 8.4 mile RT trip up Grey's/Torrey's, I brought a 100oz CamelBak, two 16oz water bottles, and one 32oz Gatorade (for electrolytes/salt). That amount of liquid is probably overkill for most people, so but it's better to have <u>too</u> much water than not enough in my opinion. The general rule of thumb is 1 liter of water for every 3 miles you hike.

3. **Stay hydrated.** Drinking when you're thirsty is too late (one can be a quart low on fluids before feeling thirsty), and puts yourself at risk for dehydration, fatigue, and cramps. According to [this article][7], the higher up you are, the more water your body needs to keep functioning. I recommend drinking small amounts of water frequently, which is another reason why a hydration bladder is nice to have.

4. **Food needs vary from person to person.**  On the trip, our group only finished **half** the food we brought. Perhaps it was the altitude, physical exhaustion, or breakfast we had in the morning. What worked well for us was eating small amounts of trail mix, beef jerky, power bars, and [Clif Shot Bloks][4] along the way. That kept our energy levels consistently high. A small lunch on the summit was more than enough. 

5. **Prepare for ALL the elements.** Check the weather report beforehand, but all bets are off when the elevation is this high. For warm weather, I had a synthetic base layer, shorts, and sunglasses. My friends had convertible pants (which looked very convenient) and hats. For rain and wind, I brought my Marmot Ether DriClime jacket and UnderArmour sweats. My friend used a poncho, but would not recommend it again since it flew around in the wind and blocked his vision of where he was stepping. I'd probably bring gloves (wet hands were ice cold from wind) and a beanie next time.

6. **Trekking poles are worth it.** As we made our way up a steep climb, a 13 year old girl caught up to us and remarked, "I'll trade you my trail mix for your trekking poles". They may look silly to some, but they reduce fatigue, stress on knees, and are a great help when negotiating slippery terrain. It's like having 4 legs to help you balance and maneuver.

7. **Understand the route and conditions. Have a map/gps.** Plan and know your route in advance. Are the paths clear of snow? Will you have to take detours? There is a ton of information at [14ers.com][5] and [ProTrails.com][6]. I was always one to scoff at maps and didn't think they were necessary.. until I couldn't determine which path we needed to take on the way down. Luckily, my friend had a GPS map on his phone.

8. **Be safe.** A small first aid kit with bandages, tape, gauze pads, and anti-bacterial wipes can go a long way. Asprin or Ibuprofen is good too. Know the signs of [altitude sickness][2]. Rest for a few minutes if you feel lightheaded, the lightheadedness is from a lack of oxygen to your brain. Bring survival gear if you expect to be pushing the limits of a day hike.

9. **Account for personal needs.** Everyone remembers the essentials such as sunscreen and bug spray, but don't neglect the simple conveniences such as toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and extra socks. Some people even bring head lamps/flashlights, iodine tablets (to clean water), floss, and matches/lighter.

10. **Enjoy it.** Completing a 14er is a memorable experience so take your time and "smell the roses". Many focus on just making it to the top, and miss out on a ton of breath-taking views. Fall into rhythm with the sounds of steps and heavy breathing as you climb a steep incline. Debate with your friends about what's going to happen next in [A Game Of Thrones][3]. And enjoy some of the best air you're ever going to breathe when you're on top.

Keep in mind these tips are based on my experiences, and that each person's comfort level is different. Hopefully, this post was able to provide a sense of what one can expect on a 14er hike and how I plan to prepare for one in the future.
