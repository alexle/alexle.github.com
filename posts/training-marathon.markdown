Training For A Marathon In 9 Weeks, Part I
09-06-2013

It's strange how quickly the mind forgets about pain. Just [3 months ago][1], I told my body it would never have to run another mile again if it could just hang on until the finish line. Now, like a mosquito drawn to one of those electric zappers, I've somehow signed up for another race - this time a full marathon.

While the "full" is a (seemingly) logical next step from a half-marathon, my situation is slightly unconventional for a couple of reasons:

1. I'm a newbie runner. I haven't been running for very long.
2. My base mileage is not close to what is needed for surviving a marathon. There are some guides that state you should be running 20 miles/week *before you even start* your training.
3. The race I signed up for was only 10 weeks away. Most training programs are 12-30 weeks in length, depending on existing fitness and running levels.

Could one adequately prepare for 26.2 miles in 9 weeks, given the above conditions? I guess we'll find out in a couple of weeks. In the meantime, I thought I'd share my experiences and what I've learned along the way, in case it might prove useful to someone.

###Running Background###

I started running 18 months ago. At the time, I could barely finish a mile. By the end of 2012, I had completed [125 miles][2] averaging 1.6 miles per run. Not bad!

This year, my running has greatly improved. I'm able to run 3 miles comfortably now, and average 10-12 miles/week. On the days I don't run, I lift weights and do CrossFit exercises at the gym. I've completed one 5k, one 10k, and one half-marathon.

###Training Plan###

After some research online, I settled on an 18-week training plan by [Hal Higdon][3]. It didn't take long to figure out which classification I was under - Novice 2. 

The key to this program is the "long slow distance" (LSD) run. These build up weekly from 8 to 20 miles, and are meant to be run 30-90 seconds per mile *slower* than your estimated race pace. As for frequency, Novice 2 breaks down each week into 3 short runs, 1 long run, 1 cross-train day, and 2 rest days. Week 1 looked manageable at 3, 5, 3, and 8 miles. Week 15 sent shivers up my spine: 5, 5, 5, and 20 miles.

The tricky part was figuring out how to condense 18 weeks into 9. I decided to focus on the middle bulk of the training, thus cutting out the short runs at the beginning and the long runs in the end. My reasoning was that I could tough out the early runs to catch up, and "wing" the longer distances on marathon day. Some plan, huh? The important aspect to me was building up mileage and endurance, *without* risking injury or burning myself out.

With that aside, below is a short log of each training week, with primary focus on the LSD. 

###Week 1 - 9mi LSD###

I started on track with short runs of 2, 5, and 3mi. Headed into the 9mi LSD, I was a bit overconfident and came out too fast. The first hour (6mi) went pretty well. Then it fell terribly apart afterwards. My pace, form, and motivation to move forward dropped dramatically until the end.

\* Lesson: Start slower. Bring water and GU next time to practice fueling.

###Week 2 - 12mi LSD###

The short runs were awesome this week at 2, 8, and 4mi. I wish I could have said the same for the 12mi LSD. Before this run, I had never run with water or GU. It sounded like a good idea to fuel at the half-way point, one hour in.

I washed down GU with 8oz water on cue at mile 6. It was then that I realized there wasn't a trash can in sight. As a result, I had to run with sticky fingers and trash for another mile before spotting a doggy-poop station. 

Mile 10 hit me hard. I felt extremely dehyrdated for some reason. I shuffled my feet home to rehydrate, and finished the last 2 miles in pain.

\* Lesson: Don't wait too long to hydrate. Make note of nearby trash cans before you GU.

###Week 3 - 13mi LSD###

I kept the short runs light this week at 3, 3, and 3mi. With a new plan to hydrate earlier this time, I set out on the 13mi LSD. This time, I hydrated 36 minutes in, followed by GU and water at 60 minutes. The last 1.5mi were tough. Overall, the run felt great. It was my best LSD yet. I secretly wished the marathon was next week so I could obliterate it.

I began to notice a trend with the LSDs. The final miles each week are really, really hard. I can now see why many people advise not to increase your weekly mileage by more than 10 percent over the previous week.

\* Lesson: 10% rule is for reals and a good principle.
