All in all, it was a busy, fun, and educational month. While I didn't make much progress towards my listed 2011 goals, I learned a lot and was able to spend quality time with my family and friends.

*Read Rework
* Took a trip to Orange County
* Replaced my car's radiator
* Fixed up dad's 19 yr old rode bike
* Helped with field day for 30+ kids

See you on the road!
