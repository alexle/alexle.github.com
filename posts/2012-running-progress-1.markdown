Update On 2012 Running Progress
05-07-2012

One of my [goals this year][1] is to run 100 miles. To keep track, I use the Nike+ app on my iPhone and enable it on every run. It's pretty cool being able to see the route, elevation, and pace of past runs and it's fairly accurate. Anyways, a third of the year has passed and I'm behind schedule. Time to turn it on, just do it!
