12 Signs That You're A Runner
09-27-2013

I'm three weeks away from my first ever marathon. I'm nervous, yet really excited. During the past couple weeks of training, it occurred to me that I've picked up some weird habits since I first started running over a year ago. I've never considered myself a runner, but a second look at these actions make me wonder if I've finally crossed that line.

What were the signs that let you know you were finally a runner? Here is my list:

1. You immediately plan which days you're going to run when looking at the weather forecast. You also start checking the [weather report][1] hourly instead of daily.

2. Carbs are your favorite food group.

3. You spend more time researching running routes than local restaurants when traveling to a new city.

4. You can recite your 5K, 10K, Half-Marathon, and Full Marathon PR down to the exact second. What you did at work yesterday, however, draws a blank.

5. You used to think runners were "crazy" while driving pass them in your car. Now you slow down to A) analyze their foot strike and form B) check out which shoes they're wearing and C) stare longingly, wishing you could be running with them.

6. You know the mileage (yes, mileage) on your running shoes.

      <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
It's been a wonderful 8 months Pure Drifts.</div>

7. Your long runs become so long, you have to check two parts of the weather forecast. The conditions when you start.. and the conditions when you expect to finish.

8. When 45 degrees means you now run with a shirt on (for guys).

9. It feels like Christmas when someone wants to talk to you about running.

10. You don't mind that your shorts are 3-4 inches shorter than before. Nor do you mind wearing a headband in public.

11. The top drawer of your dresser looks like this:

      <a href="/static/gu_drawer.jpg"><img src="/static/gu_drawer.jpg" alt="alex gu drawer" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" width="560px" /></a>
      <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
Yes, this is my drawer. And it looks so delicious.</div>

12. You're out of breath. Your heart is pounding. You've never felt pain like this before. One voice yells "stop!". Another yells otherwise. The finish is in sight. Determined, you fight through the suffering and push yourself to the end. People passing by don't comprehend why you're doubled-over and grasping for air. And in this moment, you can't help but smile. Because you gave it everything you possibly could and put your limits and boundaries to the test. That's when you know you're a runner.

I shared this list on the [Runner's World forum][2] and received some great (and funny) responses. Here are some bonus ones which I can relate to:

@Patti678 - When I started making excuses to run instead of not to -- Ex. No clean running clothes? That's ok. I'll dig dirty ones out of the hamper and wear them again.

@Texastrotter - You don't think paying $150 for running shoes is too much. Also, you get up at 4:00 or 5:00 to run, but hate to get up early.

@Rbuzz9 - You love chatting about running and shoes and running tights and singlets and GU..

@SamuelPagliarini - You're too lazy to do the math when someone gives you change on something you bought. When it comes to paces, distances, and projections you are like the new Kasparov.
