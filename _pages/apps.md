A collection of small tools and utilities I've built for myself:

## [Pace Calculator](/pace-calculator/)

A simple web app which calculates your pace per mile and total time for a given distance and time.

## [FIRE Calculator](/fire-calculator/)

A calculator that projects when you can retire early based on your savings rate, asset allocation, and withdrawal strategy.
