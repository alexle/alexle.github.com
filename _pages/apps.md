A collection of small tools and utilities I've built for fun:

## [Pace Calculator](/pace-calculator/)

A simple web app which calculates your pace per mile and total time for a given distance and time.

## [FIRE Calculator](/fire-calculator/)

A calculator that projects when you can retire early based on your savings rate, asset allocation, and withdrawal strategy.

## [Regex Lab](/regex/)

Test regular expressions with live matching, capture groups, and a quick reference guide.

## [GitHub Stats](/github-stats/)

Look up any GitHub user's public profile, language breakdown, and top repositories.
