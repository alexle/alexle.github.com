## Development

### Linting

This project uses HTMLHint for HTML linting. A pre-commit hook has been set up to automatically lint HTML files before committing.

- To manually run the linter: `npm run lint`
- To attempt to automatically fix linting issues: `npm run lint:fix`

#### Configuration

The linting rules are configured in `.htmlhintrc`. The configuration has been adjusted to work with Jekyll templates.
