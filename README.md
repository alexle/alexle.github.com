## Tech Stack

- **Jekyll 4.4.1** - Static site generator
- **GitHub Pages** - Hosting and deployment
- **SCSS/Sass** - CSS preprocessing
- **Markdown** - Content authoring
- **HTMLHint & Stylelint** - Code quality
- **Google Analytics** - Traffic tracking
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated workflows

## Development

This project uses HTMLHint and Stylelint for code quality. A pre-commit hook automatically runs linters before committing.

**Available commands:**

- `npm run lint` - Run HTML linting
- `npm run lint:scss` - Run SCSS linting
- `npm run lint:scss:fix` - Auto-fix SCSS issues

**Configuration:**

- HTML rules: `.htmlhintrc`
- SCSS rules: `.stylelintrc.json`

## Pre-commit Hooks

Automated code quality checks run before each commit using Husky:

Setup location: `.husky/pre-commit`

To modify the hooks:

1. Edit `.husky/pre-commit` to add/remove linting steps
2. Use `npm run prepare` to reinstall hooks after changes
3. Add `--no-verify` to git commit to skip hooks temporarily

## Mobile Blogging

Create blog posts from anywhere using GitHub Issues:

1. **Create a new issue**:
   - Open GitHub mobile app
   - Navigate to repository and tap "+" for new issue
   - Title: Your post title
   - Body: Your post content in markdown

2. **Add tags** (optional):
   - Include line: `Tags: tag1, tag2` in the issue body

3. **Working with drafts**:
   - Create issue without the "new-post" label
   - Continue editing until ready
   - Add the "new-post" label when ready to publish

4. **Publish post**:
   - First create the issue WITHOUT the "new-post" label
   - Add the "new-post" label when ready to publish
   - Workflow creates properly formatted post file
   - Issue is automatically closed with link to published post

5. **Edit existing posts**:
   - Navigate to `_posts` folder in GitHub
   - Edit the markdown file directly

## Image Optimization

Images are automatically optimized when added or modified in the repository:

1. **How it works**:
   - GitHub Actions workflow runs whenever images are added or modified
   - Uses the Calibre image optimization engine to compress images
   - JPEG and PNG files are compressed to 80% quality (good balance of size/quality)
   - Optimized images are automatically committed back to the repository

2. **Adding images**:
   - Place images in the `assets` folder
   - Reference in posts using markdown: `![Alt text](/assets/image.jpg)`
   - Optimization happens automatically on commit

3. **Manual optimization**:
   - You can manually trigger optimization by running the workflow from the Actions tab
   - Select the "optimize-images" workflow and click "Run workflow"

## Link Checker

Broken links are automatically checked:

- Runs weekly (Sundays at midnight)
- Runs on pushes to main that modify posts or pages
- Creates a GitHub issue if broken links are found

## Build Validation

Pull requests are automatically validated:

- Jekyll build is tested on every PR
- Ensures site builds successfully before merging
