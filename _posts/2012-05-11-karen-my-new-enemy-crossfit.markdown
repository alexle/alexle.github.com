title: "Karen, My Newest Enemy"

I recently completed my first [CrossFit][1] workout of the day - "Karen". For those of you who don't know what CrossFit is, it's a high-intensity fitness program that combines a variety of functional movements to improve strength and conditioning. Think of it as P90x or Insanity, but with different workouts and focus.

In Crossfit, the "workouts of the day", or [WODs][2], are predescribed exercises which are timed or scored. One WOD may score on how many rounds are completed within a certain time, while another WOD may score on how fast the rounds are completed. This is extremely addicting for those who enjoy measuring progress or have a competitive spirit \*cough\*.

## Who is Karen? ##

Karen consists of performing 150 [Wall Balls][3] for time. A 20lb medicine ball must be used, as well as hitting a target 10ft off the ground. Failure to hit the target or perform a full squat results in disqualification for that rep. Sound easy? Give it a try, it's been 3 days and I'm still wondering if my legs will ever heal from Karen.

Here is a video demonstrating Wall Balls and how to perform them correctly:

## My Results and Impression ##

I logged my Karen at 15:25. Unfortunately, I was only using a 16lb ball. And could only hit an 8ft target. So technically, I did not complete a full-Karen. More like a "mini-Karen".

Nonetheless, I feel very accomplished. The workout was harder than I expected, and I don't believe any amount of training could have prepared my body for this. I'm already looking forward to the next trial and am aiming to hit a 9ft target consistently.

I'm not sure how far I'll delve into Crossfit, but the exercises I've learned so far have been fun and break up the monotony of lifting weights. Karen, you kicked my butt. But when I recover, I'm coming for you.
