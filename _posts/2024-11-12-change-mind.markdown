One of my favorite questions this year has been:

> "What have you changed your mind on in the past year?"

I find it such an introspective question.

It pushes you to question your current beliefs and perspectives. Why did you believe in before? Do they still apply to who you are today?

The question "What have you changed your mind on in the last year?" is powerful because it reveals an openness to growth and a willingness to re-evaluate beliefs or decisions—traits that are fundamental to personal development. Here’s why it's especially interesting to ask:

1. **Encourages Reflection**: It pushes you to think about your experiences, assumptions, and insights from the past year, often highlighting pivotal moments you might otherwise overlook.

2. **Demonstrates Flexibility**: Answering this question can show that you're open to change, adaptive, and capable of evolving as new information or perspectives come to light. It also reinforces that it’s okay to revise opinions and beliefs.

3. **Highlights Personal Growth**: It underscores that learning isn’t static. By identifying areas where you've shifted your views, you recognize your growth and the lessons that contributed to it.

4. **Builds Self-Awareness**: Understanding what and why you've changed your mind on something increases self-awareness and can lead to healthier decision-making in the future. 

5. **Cultivates Empathy**: Recognizing changes in your own views can make you more understanding of others who hold differing perspectives, knowing that they, too, may change over time.

Overall, this question gets to the heart of how we grow as people—it's a litmus test for introspection, humility, and maturity.
