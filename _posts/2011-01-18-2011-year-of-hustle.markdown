2010 was a year of enjoying life to the fullest, personal growth, and fulfilling old dreams.

2011 will be a year of [Hustle][1]. I have so many things I want to do and accomplish. People always talk about what they want to do, or what they should do, or what they will do.. but they never do it. I don't want to be one of those people.

When I look back on this year, I want to be able to say, "Dam Alex, you kicked some ass this year". To help keep me motivated and on track, I'm going to ask myself this question at the end of every month:

> What have you accomplished this month?

Here's a list of some of the things I did in January:

* Created app on [google app engine][3]
* Learned Javascript
* Worked out 5-6 days a week; can rep 205 x 4 now

Not too much, but it's a start. In the next post, I'll share some of my goals for this year.
