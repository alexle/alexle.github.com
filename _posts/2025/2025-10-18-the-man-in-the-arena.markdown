One of my favorite quotes — and one that has quietly changed the way I live — is from Theodore Roosevelt:

> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
>
> The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;
>
>but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,
>
> and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

I used to be afraid of what others thought about my actions.

- What if I fail?
- What if they make negative comments?
- What if they were right?

But then I realized that most criticism comes from people who aren't even trying -- people who rather judge than take action themselves.

It costs nothing to criticize — to sit back, point out flaws, and say how things should have been done differently.

Staying on the sidelines is easy.

Stepping into the arena takes courage. To build. To begin. To take a chance on something that might not succeed.

I've come to greatly respect those who try -- even if it's not perfect. I find myself quietly rooting for those who dare to create, to build, to share something real.

Sometimes courage is just the act of showing up again and again.

## Dare Greatly

So the next time you catch yourself holding back — waiting for the stars to align, or worried about what others might think — remember this:

They'll always have something to say.
But they’re not in the arena. You are.

And that’s what counts.
