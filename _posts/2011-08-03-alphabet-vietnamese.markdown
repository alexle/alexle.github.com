One of my goals this year is to learn how to read Vietnamese. I'm able to understand and speak the basics, but a block of Vietnamese text could very well be hieroglyphs to me. It's strange this is the case, but I guess reading wasn't "essential" in being able to communicate with my parents at a young age.<br />

Like most other languages, learning the alphabet is one of the first steps to reading so this is where I'll start. Here's a Vietnamese alphabet <a href="http://mylanguages.org/vietnamese_alphabet.php">list</a> I found online to study:<br />

<table border="1" cellpadding="3px" cellspacing="0px" width="520px"><tbody>
<tr><td width="100px">Vowels</td><td width="400px">Pronunciation Example</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>a</b></td><td>'ah' as in father</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>â</b></td><td>'uh' as in sofa</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>ă</b></td><td>'a' as in hat</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>e</b></td><td>'e' as in get</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>ê</b></td><td>'eh' as in prey</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>i</b></td><td>'i' as in machine (north), 'i' as in bit (south)</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
